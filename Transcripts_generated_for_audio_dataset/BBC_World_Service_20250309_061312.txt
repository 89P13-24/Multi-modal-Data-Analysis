 Diplomatic Front, during the week coming, President Zelensky, I know, has now named the delegation that is being sent to Saudi Arabia to meet US negotiators. This is obviously following that disastrous meeting in the White House. How important does that meeting now look, do you think? So this is the highest meeting since the disaster at the White House back in, back on October, February 28th. For Ukraine, it's important because it wants to show that there's still a diplomatic channel out there with the US and that Ukraine, especially to its people, it's important that they're trying to do, that they're showing that they want to do something because they see that the US is still a very important partner, that it needs their support. So it's good that the US is still also willing to meet Ukraine. So I don't think people expect much big progress out of it, but it's still important that they meet for symbolic purposes. Thank you very much, Asami Terajima, who works at the Kiev Independent newspaper and will hear more voices out of Ukraine during the rest of the program. You're with Weekend from the BBC World Service.
