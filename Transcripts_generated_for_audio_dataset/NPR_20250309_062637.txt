 As they might in the finals the Lakers are scalded and they've won eight in a row with their new star player Luca Doncic On the same team as a guy named LeBron. What are you going to be looking out for? I'm gonna be looking to see how the Celtics respond to this They've already lost to the Lakers once before the Luca trade there. They are the defending champions They do not play well at home and yet these are statement games I know that it's a long season and everybody has to get their rest and all the load management stuff and In an 82 game season, it's hard to say that anything is a signature game But it's March now and the Lakers made a blockbuster trade and the Celtics are the defending champions And this is when you start circling the games even when you're the player you start saying to yourself Hey, we might see these guys in June. And so there's that and then there's also the biggest thing. It's Lakers Celtics You're always supposed to get up for that for those games And even if you're a player and you've got a whole bunch of these things for the fans This is a game that everybody circles and we want to see what the Celtics are gonna do I also want to take a moment to acknowledge that this week LeBron James became the first 50,000 point player in NBA history He entered the league when he was 18 Cleveland zone playing for the Cavs straight out of high school now 40 and Still playing like one of the greatest ever. Yeah, he's he is there
