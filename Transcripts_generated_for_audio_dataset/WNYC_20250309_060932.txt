 again repeated, reiterated the same political stance that they had. They said that it's either make a deal with us or there would be a military strike against Iran. But just to put it in a context, this is not the first time that Trump has sent a letter back in 2019. He did the same thing through late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Khamenei did not even accept the letter and said that it was not worthy a response. So it appears he wants to have the same strategy this time and resist against this maximum pressure campaign. And one wonders where this goes from here. What do you see as the next likely development? So Iran has a lot at stake because if Americans give the green light to Israelis, as Donald Trump has promised to strike against Iran, that can turn into a full blown war, which is really dangerous for Iran. But also Iranians have been suffering, ordinary people have been suffering economically and also they've got social grievances. So there is a possibility of a nationwide protest like back in 2021. Thank you very much, Panem Jobari from the BBC's Persian service. There's been a wave of clashes between Russian and Ukrainian forces after President Trump suspended military aid to Ukraine last week.
