TITLE: What is Unrivaled? Rules, rosters for new basketball league

Women's basketball has been growing at an exponential pace over the past several years. On Friday, it will expand even more when Unrivaled tips off in Miami.
A new 3-on-3 league, Unrivaled is a domestic opportunity for WNBA players to compete during the offseason. But to those who helped bring the league to fruition, it was about bringing competitive basketball back to its simplest, rawest form, like playing hoops on the playground.
"Everything was built for the players," Luke Cooper, Unrivaled's president of basketball operations, told ESPN. "The business was built for the players, the facility was built for the players, and the actual game -- the 3-on-3 full court is rooted in how you would play basketball as a kid."
Here's everything you need to know about the league ahead of its inaugural season.
Since the WNBA's inaugural season in 1997, many of the league's players have headed overseas to continue playing in the offseason -- both to supplement their income and find high-level competition.
Founded by Breanna Stewart and Napheesa Collier, Unrivaled provides an opportunity for 36 of the top WNBA players to remain in the United States for an eight-week season that runs Jan. 17 to March 17 in a custom-built facility in Miami. It's not the first domestic alternative league. Athletes Unlimited, a 5-on-5 league that launched in 2022, will play its fourth season from Feb. 5 to March 2 in Nashville, with 29 of 40 participants having WNBA experience.
But Unrivaled, which will consist of six teams, looks to set itself apart with its salaries, amenities and style of play.
"It was built by basketball people for basketball players," Cooper said. "That's our north star. ... We have an incredible pool of 36 players that will make each other better, so we're unique in that sense in the marketplace."
Unrivaled aims to be the first league to compete with the WNBA financially and with its resources.
Unrivaled officials said the league has surpassed $35 million in funding, with Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo, Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps, U.S. Open champion Coco Gauff, South Carolina women's basketball coach Dawn Staley and USC star JuJu Watkins among the investors.
When the league was announced, one of Unrivaled's selling points was that its average salaries would be higher than the WNBA's -- albeit with a fourth as many players.
The average salary in the WNBA in 2024 was about $119,500, with the high around $242,000.
Unrivaled has said it is offering "the highest average salary in professional women's (team) sports." League president Alex Bazzell told SB Nation in December that Unrivaled has a total salary pool of $8 million, which puts the league's average salary around $222,222.
In addition to their salary, Unrivaled players get equity in the league. Unrivaled officials declined to discuss the league's player compensation with ESPN.
Unrivaled set out to get as many top WNBA players as possible to commit to the league. When league officials pitched it to them, all they had was a concept: "This is what we hope it's going to look like," and "this is what we want it to feel like."
"I give a lot of credit to these players," Cooper said. "They took a risk."
The 36 players competing in Unrivaled this season includes seven No. 1 WNBA draft picks (Aliyah Boston, Rhyne Howard, Sabrina Ionescu, Jackie Young, Stewart, Jewell Loyd and Brittney Griner), one WNBA MVP (Stewart) and 17 former Olympians.
Cameron Brink, the No. 2 pick in the 2024 WNBA draft, has committed to playing in Unrivaled but will sit out this season as she recovers from a June 2024 ACL injury.
A'ja Wilson, the reigning WNBA MVP, and Rookie of the Year Caitlin Clark opted not to participate in Unrivaled this season.
UConn senior Paige Bueckers, the projected No. 1 pick in April's WNBA draft, and LSU junior Flau'Jae Johnson have signed NIL deals with Unrivaled. Bueckers is expected to join the league in 2026.
On Nov. 20, all six Unrivaled head coaches met in Miami to select the teams. Thirty-four of the league's 36 players (the two wild-card spots were still being decided) were separated into six pods based on positions and style of play. From there, the six coaches worked collaboratively to create each team, picking at least one player from each pod with the goal of building balanced rosters.
But the coaches had no idea which teams they'd be leading until after the selection process was complete.
"It was putting the onus back on the coaches," Cooper said.

The Unrivaled season will last eight weeks, including playoffs, and will be played entirely at the MediaPro Center in Miami. Games will be played each week on Monday, Friday and Saturday.

The regular season will consist of a round-robin format, with the six teams facing each opponent at least once and each team playing 14 games. The top four teams based on record will advance to the playoffs. Head-to-head records and point differential will serve as tiebreakers.
The playoffs start March 16 -- which is also Selection Sunday for men's and women's college basketball -- with two single-elimination semifinal games. The championship game is March 17.
Unrivaled also recently announced it will hold a 1-on-1 tournament from Feb. 10 to 14 that pits players against one another in a single-elimination, winner-take-all competition with a $250,000 reward for the winner and an additional $10,000 for their 3-on-3 teammates.
Unrivaled will be played on a 49.2-by-72-foot condensed full court rather than the half court (36 feet by 49 feet) used at the Olympics. For reference, the WNBA is played on a 94-by-50-foot court.
"It feels like you are watching a basketball game and there just happens to be four less players on the court," Cooper said. "It's not a gimmick. It's basketball with more space to operate with and a little shorter of a court, so the players have the stamina to play."
Each Unrivaled game will feature three seven-minute quarters and a fourth quarter that the league is calling "winning score." The winning score will be determined by adding 11 points to the leading team's score through three quarters. For example, if the score is 50-48 heading into the final quarter, the first team to reach 61 points wins. There will never be overtime.
"This game is rooted in how you would play basketball as a kid on a black top," Cooper said. "There's flow. There's pace."
Unrivaled organizers hope playing to a target score eliminates late fouls and speeds up the game overall. To that end, the free throw process also will be different. When a player is fouled -- whether on a layup or a 3-pointer -- only one free throw will be awarded. The single shot is worth two points for a foul on a 2-point field goal or three points if the foul occurred on a 3-point attempt. A free throw attempt after a foul on a made basket is worth one point.
Players will foul out after their sixth foul, but if the team has only three players available and one of them picks up a sixth foul, the player will remain in the game but incur technical fouls for each additional foul they commit.
The games will use an 18-second shot clock, compared to the WNBA's 24 seconds, and the clock will be stopped on made baskets only in the last 30 seconds of periods rather than in the last minute.
Except for tip-off at the start of the game, all jump ball situations are replaced by alternating possessions.
The six head coaches have different levels of experience in the NBA and WNBA, headlined by former Chicago Sky coach Teresa Weatherspoon and former NBA assistant coach Phil Handy, who most recently spent five seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Weatherspoon will lead the Vinyl, while Handy will coach the Mist.
Former Washington Mystics assistant Andrew Wade will lead the Laces, and Nola Henry, who recently spent time with the Los Angeles Sparks, will coach the Rose. Adam Harrington, a former assistant and director for player development for the Brooklyn Nets, will coach the Phantom. And WNBA and NBA skills coach DJ Sackmann will coach the Lunar Owls.

Monday and Friday night games will be on TNT, the league's broadcast rights holder. Saturday games will be shown on TruTV. All games will also be available for streaming on Max.

Here at Bracketology HQ, we track every result every night, ranking and reranking what will eventually comprise the NCAA tournament's field of 68. With major conference play in its final week, our projections will continue to update twice a week, Tuesday and Friday, and then daily as individual automatic bids are awarded.
Auburn
Oklahoma
Boise State
Much has been made of this season's attempt by the SEC to break the record for most NCAA bids from a single conference. Also possible for the league is another "record," if you will: that of the team with the worst conference mark to ever make the NCAA field. That standard, four games below .500, was last hit two years ago by West Virginia (19-15, 7-11 Big 12). In our latest Bracketology, both Georgia and Arkansas would equal that mark with both Texas (5-11 in the SEC) and Oklahoma (4-12!) among the First Four Out. How low is too low? Currently, conference affiliation and record are not listed on selection committee team sheets. Every game, every win and every loss is weighed equally. Yes, Oklahoma and Texas have combined for nine Q1 wins. They've also combined for a whopping 19 Q1 losses. That's a .321 winning percentage, with roughly half the games at home. If that's an NCAA tournament team ...

RULES
ESPN's Bracketology efforts are focused on projecting the NCAA tournament field just as we expect the NCAA Division I basketball committee to select the field in March. ESPN bracketologist Joe Lunardi uses the same data points favored by the committee, including strength of schedule and other season-long indicators, including the NET and team-sheet data similar to what is available to the NCAA, in his projections of the field. Visit the NCAA's website for a fuller understanding of NCAA selection criteria.
68-Team Bracket
The 68-team bracket is the standard version of the NCAA tournament field that has been in place since 2011. If the 2021 field is comprised of 68 teams, there will be some key differences to past years, however.
The primary adjustment from a normal year is, of course, the playing of the entire NCAA tournament at a single site. This eliminates the need for geographical considerations in seeding. Additionally, there will be at least one fewer automatic qualifier this season, as the Ivy League's decision to forgo the 2020-21 season reduces the number of AQ entries to 31 for this season.
48-Team Bracket
In this projection, a condensed selection process would reduce the field by 10 at-large teams and 10 automatic qualifiers (the latter of which still receive a revenue unit). The top four seeds in each region would receive a bye into the second round, with four first-round games per region - 5 vs. 12, 6 vs. 11, 7 vs. 10 and 8 vs. 9 - being played without fans on the higher seed's home court.
To minimize travel, first-round pairings will be guided by geography to the greatest extent possible. And the reduced field results in only 32 teams competing at the central site. All participants must post a minimum .500 conference record - the "Lunardi Rule" - for at-large consideration.
16-Team Bracket
In this projection, the committee selects and seeds the 16 best available teams. There are no automatic qualifiers, although all non-competing conference champions receive the designated revenue unit.
To maintain some sense of national balance, conference participation is capped at four teams. And no region shall have more than one team from the same conference.

The mining and reassessing of data never stops. After losing Wednesday, Minnesota dropped to the last team in the field. Upon further review, the Gophers are out of the projection, even though no other bubble teams stepped forward. Virginia Tech, even after a loss Thursday, is now the last team in the field. Why do the Hokies have the edge? Each team has advantages over the other in different areas, although none of the numbers are pretty. Minnesota has lost five of its past six games. Virginia Tech has dropped four of six. The Hokies' 1-7 record in Quad 1 games is just better than Minnesota's 0-6, but the Gophers have a better NET rating (38 to 46). The biggest problem with Virginia Tech's candidacy is four losses (including two at home) against teams not in NCAA tournament consideration (Virginia, Syracuse, Stanford and Boston College); the Gophers have no such losses. But the Hokies' 3-7 record against tournament teams (Minnesota is 2-11) ultimately puts them in the field. Nothing illustrates the weakness of this season's bubble than this battle for the final spot.

RULES
ESPN's Bracketology efforts are focused on projecting the NCAA tournament field just as we expect the NCAA Division I basketball committee to select the field in March. ESPN bracketologist Charlie Creme uses the same data points favored by the committee, including strength of schedule and other season-long indicators, including the NET and team-sheet data similar to what is available to the NCAA, in his projections of the field. Visit the NCAA's website for a fuller understanding of NCAA selection criteria.
64-Team Bracket
The 64-team bracket is the standard version of the NCAA tournament field that has been in place since 1994. If the 2021 field is comprised of 64 teams, there will be some key differences to past years, however.
The primary adjustment from a normal year is, of course, the playing of the entire NCAA tournament at a single site. This eliminates the need for geographical considerations in seeding. Additionally, there will be at least one fewer automatic qualifier this season, as the Ivy League's decision to forgo the 2020-21 season reduces the number of AQ entries to 31 for this season.
48-Team Bracket
In this projection, a condensed selection process would reduce the field by eight at-large teams and eight automatic qualifiers (the latter of which still receive a revenue unit). The top four seeds in each region would receive a bye into the second round, with four first-round games per region - 5 vs. 12, 6 vs. 11, 7 vs. 10 and 8 vs. 9.
16-Team Bracket
In this projection, the committee selects and seeds the 16 best available teams. There are no automatic qualifiers, although all non-competing conference champions receive the designated revenue unit.
To maintain some sense of national balance, conference participation is capped at four teams. And no region shall have more than one team from the same conference.

TITLE: What Jamahl Mosley, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Wendell Carter Jr. Said After Magic's Loss to Bulls

CONTENT:
ORLANDO, Fla. â The Orlando Magic dropped their fifth straight contest Thursday night, falling to the Chicago Bulls 125-123.
Recap: White scores 44, Magic drop fifth straight in shootout with Bulls
After the game, Magic coach Jamahl Mosley, guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and center Wendell Carter Jr. met reporters to discuss the result.
Here's a partial transcript and video of each availability.
âWe gave up 69 points in the first half, gave up 13 offensive rebounds, I think thatâs a big portion of it and then Coby White got going. But again, it was that first half defense that set us back a little bit. Yes, it was only a three-point game, but our ability to stop the attack downhill and then giving up second chance points was tough there.â
âI think weâve got to sit down and lock in and understand exactly who weâre guarding and how theyâre guarding. You know, Coby White was able to turn the corner, second chance points, a couple of hustle plays, three offensive rebounds in a row on one possession and I think that gave up the three. Those are deflating possessions that weâve just got to come away with. I think thatâs a big portion of this game right now, but I think [when] you give up 13 offensive rebounds it becomes deflating to your defense when you do get the initial stop.â
âThe message at the end was we have to fight our way out of this funk. Itâs exactly what it is, itâs a funk and weâve got to fight our way out of it. So, our ability to go on the road, regroup, reset our mind and what we need to do and band together on the road and continue to fight, continue to fight. Because in this league, it can turn fast one way or the other and I think our guys need to...will understand exactly what we need to do in order to turn that.â
âI mean they had 25 fast break points, so that was a major, major, major key. Understanding that they were pushing it make or miss, I think they had a few baskets directly after a few makes, man down a couple times we attacked the rim, got there, made it and they were pushing it back down at us. So, our ability to sprint the entire game, it was key. But then the extra possessions, our ability to understand how we want to guard, not letting guys just drive right by you and recognizing when you help and when you donât help. But again, protecting that rim first and then getting out to shooters.â
âWeâre just trying to find a way. Right now, weâre in a bad situation where weâre playing as well as we can, coming out with these nailbiters, and I think we just have to figure it out whatâs the cause of it, why weâre not ready at half or whatever it may be. We just have to find a way. I donât think itâs any message. Weâve got to get it, regardless.â
âI mean, just contain him. He's a great player. He was getting to the basket. He was getting easy layups where we missed low man help. And his pull-up threeâs; most of them [were] wide open but heâs a great shooter. He just put the ball in the basket tonight.â
âI mean, just the pace that the Bulls had. They [were] getting the ball out pretty fast, make or miss they were getting it down the floor. They [were] either getting â we were fouling, or they were getting easy layups, or a kick out three. I think thatâs what â pretty much the whole first half, thatâs what they were doing. In the second half, we kind of just slowed them down in transition [and] made them play more in the half court.â
âIn my opinion, I never feel like itâs the last couple of possessions. I think itâs kind of a snowball effect, starting off in the third (quarters); most thirds. I think we did a solid job in the third tonight but thatâs kind of been our trend. We got out of the locker room a little bit earlier than usual. I think thatâs where we have to spring forward and do well in the third. I donât know honestly. I might have to go back and watch from just thinking. Iâm assuming it was the offensive rebounds and transition. Weâve got to know our personnel a little bit better. From top to bottom guys have to know who theyâre guarding and know their tendencies and do a better job of guarding your yards, [as] we would say.â
The Magic embark on a five-game road trip, which begins Saturday, March 8 at the Milwaukee Bucks at 8 p.m. ET.

TITLE: Draymond Green Makes Bold Statement After Warriors-Nets Game

CONTENT:
On Thursday night, the Golden State Warriors beat the Brooklyn Nets (in New York) by a score of 121-119.
At one point, the team trailed by as many as 22 points, but a resilient second quarter put them in position for a comeback.
After the game, Draymond Green made a bold statement when he met with the media.
Green: "We were down 27-5, and I looked over, and nobody blinked. Everybody was just like, alright, here we go, figure it out and we did that... We can get great looks, and we're always going to be able to get stops."
Green finished the win with seven points, seven rebounds and ten assists while shooting 2/5 from the field in 34 minutes of playing time.
Via StatMamba: "Draymond Green has the 3rd most 10-AST games by a non-guard in NBA history.Only LeBron & Jokic have more."

Green is now averaging 8.9 points, 6.1 rebounds, 5.8 assists, 1.3 steals and 1.0 blocks per contest while shooting 42.8% from the field and 32.7% from the three-point range in 49 games.
He is in his 13th NBA season (all with Golden State).
With the win, the Warriors improved to 35-28 in 63 games, which has them as the sixth seed in the Western Conference.
They are in the middle of a three-game winning streak (and have won eight out of their last ten).
Following the Nets, the Warriors will now return home to host Malik Beasley and the Detroit Pistons on Saturday night at the Chase Center.

TITLE: Maya Moore Details How Caitlin Clark Can Become a Better Leader in WNBA

CONTENT:
Anybody who's a Caitlin Clark fan is probably well aware of how much she adores WNBA legend Maya Moore.
When speaking with the media about witnessing Moore's jersey retirement with the Minnesota Lynx on August 20, Clark said, "Obviously, for me as a little kid, it's a full circle moment for myself. I'm getting to live out my dream of playing in the WNBA, and being in the arena when they're retiring her jersey... someone that's done so much for this league, done so much for society and the world, she's a great individual and great person."
The Feverâs next game is at Minnesota, when the Lynx will be retiring 4x WNBA champion Maya Mooreâs jersey.Moore was one of Clarkâs idols growing up, and being there for that ceremony will be a âfull circle moment:â pic.twitter.com/ODOdv8Ai7Q
Moore is clearly a fan of Clark, as well. And during a March 6 appearance on SportsCenter, Moore got candid about the "next steps" Clark can take for her continued WNBA growth.
"You know, next steps, gosh, in this generation, you have so many more challenges of how to handle yourself as an adult, right?" Moore said, per an X post from Vanshay Murdock. "You go through that whirlwind of being a senior in college, transitioning into the W.
"And then the next step is how to become an even better leader," Moore continued of Clark. "And so much of leadership I think is listening, and learning. And hopefully the more she can get connected to vets in the league, and just different people, and coaches, and anyone that she can glean wisdom from, of how to just continue to learn how to be as connected and inspiring of a leader as she can be. And a lot of that is walking the walk, not just talking the talk.
"So she's already on her way," Moore added. "But continuing to have fun, continuing to anticipate how people are going to try to stop her, and being prepared as she can be for next season."

TITLE: A's Extend Lawrence Butler, and How That Stacks Up with Atlanta Braves' Star
DATE: 
URL: https://www.si.com/mlb/athletics/news/a-s-extend-lawrence-butler-and-how-that-stacks-up-with-atlanta-braves-star-01jnqj9a2jw5
CONTENT:
According to Jeff Passan of ESPN, the Athletics have extended right fielder Lawrence Butler for seven years and $66.5 million. With the A's set to play a pair of spring training games in Las Vegas this weekend, the team is making sure to be in the headlines, with the club also announcing the hiring of former Las Vegas Raiders president Marc Badain for the same role with the green and gold.
Butler, 24, broke out in a big way in July of 2024, and finished the second half of last season as one of the top-10 bats in baseball. From July 1 on, he hit .302 with a .346 OBP, slugging 20 home runs and driving in 49 RBI. He also swiped 14 bags in that span for good measure.
During that stretch, he had a 167 wRC+ (100 is league average), which ranked him No. 8 behind guys like Aaron Judge, Bobby Witt Jr., Yordan Alvarez, and Brent Rooker. He was also just a touch better than Francisco Lindor (166). That's some elite company to be in for that length of time, and if his start to spring training has been any indication, he's not going to be slowing down in 2025.
So far he has gone 9-for-16 in camp, good for a .563 average, adding two homers and five RBI to the mix. Butler has potential superstar written all over him.
feed
The reason the A's must have felt comfortable with the deal is because of the adjustment Butler made at the dish right around the time that he took off. He started keeping his head still at the plate, and the ball started flying off his bat.
The big question on everyone's mind here is how his extension stacks up compared to that of his good friend Michael Harris II of the Atlanta Braves. Harris' deal was signed in 2022, and was for eight years and $72 million.
For those wondering why the dollar figures on each are somewhat low compared to the deals that Juan Soto and Shohei Ohtani have received the past two off-seasons, it's because both Harris and Butler were pre-arbitration when they signed, not free agents.
For Butler, he had two seasons of pre-arbitration left before he even started making more modest sums of money in arbitration. This way, he gets $66.5 million guaranteed and the A's receive a couple of extra years of service time. This deal will now keep him under club control through the 2031 campaign, when he would have previously hit free agency after 2029.
Those pre-arbitration seasons would have carried salaries of $760,000 and $780,000, which is part of the reason the years and dollar figure appears low.
For those that haven't skipped ahead, the way the math works out between Butler and Harris II is that the A's slugger will be getting $9.5 per season on average, though the actual payments each year may vary.
By comparison, Harris is making an average of $9 million. The first round goes to Butler on AAV. Yet, Harris is set to make slightly more overall thanks to the extra year, and he also has two more years with club options attached, valued at $15 million in 2031 and $20 million in 2032.
If the Braves pick up those options down the road, Harris would end up winning both the AAV title, as well as the overall total.
The A's have now locked up their two big sluggers in Brent Rooker and Lawrence Butler for the foreseeable future, even with the franchise's final destination somewhat uncertain.
Next. A's Land New President. A's Land New President. dark

TITLE: 5 NBA Teams That Should Start Tanking Now
DATE: 
URL: https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25167233-5-nba-teams-should-start-tanking-now
CONTENT:
Firing up the tank three-quarters of the way through the NBA regular season is never ideal. Earlier is always better. Sometimes, though, designed eleventh-hour descents are necessary.
These five teams are living proof.
Our late-season bottom-out candidates run the gamut of unexpected and unintended consequences.  Some squads must adjust in the face of insurmountable misfortune. Others, meanwhile, should consider course correcting after overachieving relative to expectations. Then, of course, we have the lone "You should've pulled the ripcord months ago" wolf.
To be sure: All of these teams can make up only so much ground in the pursuit of better lottery odds. None of them are in position to win the race to the absolute bottom. Tanking their hearts out is worth it anyway.
The Brooklyn Nets technically entered tanking mode the moment they re-acquired control of their next two first-round picks from the Houston Rockets. They have since overachieved at virtually every turn.
Pluckier than expected performances to start the year, particularly on offense, led them to flipping Dennis Schröder and Dorian Finney-Smith before the trade deadline. Those selloffs have worked as intended...sort of.
Brooklyn ranks dead last in offensive efficiency and 29th in net rating since Jan. 1. It still hasn't resulted in enough losing when you consider how much ground must be made up.
Kudos to head coach Jordi Fernandez and his troops for cobbling together pesky defensive stands to combat offensive deficits. The Nets are sixth in points allowed per possession over the past month-and-a-half. But the stakes are too high to keep this up.
Two losses separate Brooklyn from the fifth-worst record. Dipping that far will require out-losing the Philadelphia 76ers and Toronto Raptors while keeping the Chicago Bulls, who are directly in front of the Nets, at bay.
Steering into the skid is an inexact science relative to Brooklyn's personnel. It doesn't employ a singular tank-ruiner—unless you count Fernandez. Controlling the controllables is more so the mission. In this case, that amounts to limiting run for Cam Johnson, Nicolas Claxton and probably Day'Ron Sharpe, too.
Jettisoning Zach LaVine in advance of the trade deadline was both too little and too late for the Chicago Bulls. They are 22nd in net rating since Jan. 1 and 24th since the Feb. 8 deadline, and yet they're still on pace to fall butt-backwards into the Eastern Conference play-in tournament.
A precipitous fall is officially out of the question. The Bulls have the eighth-worst record, which they should be locked into given how far the closest "challenger" sits in the standings. Their "ceiling" is likely the No. 5 lottery slot, currently owned by the Toronto Raptors, who have four more losses.
Offsetting that gap may prove impossible. But the Bulls won't know until they try.
Emphasizing minutes for Matas Buzelis is a good start. Ditto for LaVine's departure. Ayo Dosunmu's season-ending shoulder surgery fits the motif. Chicago must continue to push the envelop. Coby White doesn't need to play in every game. The same goes for Josh Giddey if he's going to continue shooting the lights out from three.
Nikola Vučević minutes (when healthy) are tank adjacent as this point. The same cannot be said for Lonzo Ball. Or even Kevin Huerter. Give Chicagoans what they need, Bulls. This is to say, give them more of Julian Phillips, Dalen Terry, Talen Horton-Tucker, et al.
Trading Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers arguably ruined the Dallas Mavericks' chances of doing anything worthwhile. Injuries have since cemented their trajectory to nowhere.
Kyrie Irving is done for the season after suffering a torn ACL in his left knee. Anthony Davis has not played since making his Mavs debut on Feb. 8 due to a groin injury. A fractured right ankle has kept Dereck Lively II on the sidelines for almost two months. Daniel Gafford (sprained right MCL) is barely halfway through a projected six-week absence. Caleb Martin has been out with a hip issue since before getting traded to Dallas.
The Mavs' season is over.
This group might have a large enough cushion as (non-Kyrie) players return to preserve their play-in chances. Tenth-place Dallas is three losses ahead of the 11th-place Phoenix Suns. But what's the point? Extending the inevitable by one game makes no sense—particularly when there's ample room to fall.
At least four teams below have no intention of throwing in the towel: The Suns, Atlanta Hawks, Miami Heat and Orlando Magic. This list extends to five if you believe the Portland Trail Blazers embrace the play-in race. The Mavs have a real opportunity to grab top-10 lottery odds. And since they control only their next two first-rounders before surrendering rights to the following four, they might as well seize it.
Officially shutting down Joel Embiid for the rest of the season could signal the Philadelphia 76ers' commitment to tanking. Nobody told Paul George.
Philadelphia was, in truth, screwed long before now. Embiid seldom looked like himself this year. The Sixers are going nowhere without him at the peak of his powers, let alone without him, period.
Tyrese Maxey's back issues merely underscore the importance of shutting down him and George and, frankly, even Quentin Grimes. Granted, Philadelphia isn't guaranteed to keep its pick. It'll head to the Oklahoma City Thunder if it lands outside the top six.
Fortunately(?) for the Sixers, they are currently tied for the NBA's sixth-worst record. If they try to not try hard enough, they might even be able to attain bottom-five standing. At the very least, they need to fend off fellow should-be tankers in Brooklyn and Chicago.
Fifth-place lottery odds give Philly a 64 percent chance of keeping its pick. The No. 6 spot lowers that to 43.4 percent. The No. 7 slot drags it down to 34.5 percent.
None of those odds are particularly killer. But when you owe Embiid $248.1 million over the next four years, without any injury protections, you must roll the dice on game-changing talent (or asset) infusion any way you can. Failing that, you might as well protect your remaining most important players from potential injury as you cross your fingers for better luck next year.
The Portland Trail Blazers earn the final nod over the San Antonio Spurs. It is not an easy call.
Victor Wembanyama is done for the season after being diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder. His absence nukes any chance the Spurs have of party-crashing the play-in and playoff pictures.
Still, four losses separate San Antonio from the next spot down in the standings. It is not negating that kind of ground. With only one of the teams in the same vicinity (these Blazers) looming as tanking candidates, the Spurs are better served gleaning more information about how De'Aaron Fox, Stephon Castle, Devin Vassell and Jeremy Sochan can all fit together—or at least within the same rotation.
For Portland's part, there is prospective meaning in attempting to prolong its hot streak. The Blazers are comfortably above .500 with a top-five defense since Jan. 1, and this success is being driven by players who matter to the long-term program. If they believe Scoot Henderson can be The Guy moving forward, prioritizing better lottery odds isn't nearly as high-stakes for them as others.
At the same time, Portland has wiggle room to lean further into the youth movement. And while it already employs a quartet of high-end sub-25-year-olds in Henderson, Toumani Camara, Donovan Clingan and Shaedon Sharpe, it can't guarantee any of them are certified tentpoles.
Bites at the building-block apple must continue to take precedence. Even if it's a matter of just detaching themselves from the San Antonio-Atlanta-Orlando-Phoenix gaggle, the Blazers are better off treading water or marginally increasing their chances at a top-four pick.

TITLE: Final NHL Trade Block Big Board 1 Day From the 2025 Deadline
DATE: 
URL: https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25166802-final-nhl-trade-block-big-board-1-day-2025-deadline
CONTENT:
The NHL's annual trade deadline is 3 p.m. ET on Friday. As the big day approaches, we can expect plenty of player movement as buyers attempt to load up their rosters for the playoffs, while sellers try to move players (usually pending free agents) who no longer fit in their long-term plans.
Since we published our previous trade board, there has been plenty of activity in the trade market. Two players on our list changed teams last Saturday: The Chicago Blackhawks shipped Seth Jones to the Florida Panthers, and the New York Rangers sent Ryan Lindgren to the Colorado Avalanche.
A three-team trade on Tuesday saw forward Trent Frederic dealt by the Boston Bruins to the Edmonton Oilers via the New Jersey Devils. Meanwhile, center Jake Evans came off our list after signing a four-year contract extension with the Montreal Canadiens.
We've also removed several players who were on our previous board. Some, such as Columbus Blue Jackets defenseman Ivan Provorov, no longer appear available. Others, like Boston Bruins captain Brad Marchand, are sidelined by injuries.
Several noteworthy stars remain among our trade candidates. They include New York Islanders center Brock Nelson, Carolina Hurricanes winger Mikko Rantanen, St. Louis Blues center Brayden Schenn, and Vancouver Canucks winger Brock Boeser.
In our final Trade Block Big Board before the deadline, we've listed 15 players we consider the most likely to be moved. Skill, experience, contracts and the frequency of appearance in recent media trade speculation factored into this compilation.
Trade speculation about Erik Karlsson surfaced in February after the Pittsburgh Penguins defenseman's solid performance for Sweden in the 4 Nations Face-Off. It earned him the No. 19 spot on our previous trade board.
If the opportunity arose, Penguins general manager Kyle Dubas could move the 34-year-old. However, his contract remains a major sticking point. The Penguins carry $10 million of his $11.5 million AAV through 2026-27. He also has a full no-movement clause.
Karlsson's contract was the reason Matt Vensel of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette played down the speculation around the veteran blueliner. On March 2, the Swede told reporters he hadn't been approached by management about waiving his clause.
The Penguins are unlikely to find a suitable offer for Karlsson by the trade deadline. However, Seth Jones also had what seemed to be an unmoveable contract, but he wound up being shipped to the Florida Panthers on Saturday.
That's why Karlsson remains on our trade board.
Rasmus Ristolainen's stock has been tumbling on our recent trade block big boards. Sitting at No. 2 a month ago, he slid to No. 10 on our previous ranking and has tumbled to his current position on this board.
It's not the Finn's performance that has affected his ranking, though. The Flyers aren't in a rush to move the big blueliner. He has two more years remaining on his contract with an annual cap hit of $5.1 million.
In our previous trade board, we noted a report by The Athletic's Kevin Kurz indicating Philadelphia wasn't receiving many calls for Ristolainen. On March 1, Kurz reported that he remains a valuable player for the team as it retools its roster.
The 30-year-old could still be moved by the deadline if a desperate contender is willing to meet the Flyers' high asking price, which would include a first-round pick. But that likelihood is fading.
A fixture in the rumor mill going back to 2022-23, John Gibson remains a player of interest leading up to the trade deadline. We had the Anaheim Ducks goaltender at No. 15 on our previous trade board.
Since last season, the 31-year-old has split the Ducks' goaltending duties with Lukas Dostal. That has fueled speculation he could be moved at the deadline, but his contract remains a significant obstacle. He's signed through 2026-27 with an AAV of $6.4 million and a 10-team no-trade list.
On March 2, The Athletic's Eric Stephens reported Gibson is open to a trade where he'll have a clear path to being a full-time starter. The Carolina Hurricanes and Edmonton Oilers are believed to be among his preferred trade destinations.
Stephens indicated the Ducks prefer not to retain part of his salary to facilitate a trade but aren't ruling it out completely. They have the cap room to acquire an expiring contract if it helps them move Gibson's contract.
A contender desperate for a goaltending upgrade might take the chance by Friday.
The Buffalo Sabres continue to surface frequently in the rumor mill, with 24-year-old center Dylan Cozens as the focal point. He was ninth on our previous trade board.
On Feb. 28, TSN's Chris Johnston reported there was plenty of interest in Cozens, winger Alex Tuch and defenseman Bowen Byram. The next day, Daily Faceoff's Frank Seravalli noted the Sabres were getting calls about JJ Peterka.
Johnston indicated Buffalo hasn't received suitable offers for those players. That's probably because teams are offering future assets rather than players of equal value. GM Kevyn Adams would prefer to make a trade similar to last year's acquisition of Byram from the Colorado Avalanche for Casey Mittelstadt.
Adams could trade Cozens (or Tuch, Byram or Peterka) if someone is willing to meet his asking price by the deadline. Otherwise, they won't be going anywhere.
On Feb. 4, Sportsnet's Elliotte Friedman told The FAN Hockey Show that the Vancouver Canucks had let the rest of the NHL know Carson Soucy was available in the trade market.
The 30-year-old defenseman has seen his ice time reduced since the team acquired Marcus Pettersson over a month ago.
Soucy is in the second season of a three-year contract with an annual cap hit of $3.3 million. He also had a full no-trade clause for this season, giving him full control over possible trade destinations.
The 6'5”, 208-pounder is a big shutdown defenseman who played well for the Canucks last season. He's a left-shot defenseman but can play either side of the blue line.
On March 4, CHEK-TV's Rick Dhaliwal reported he hasn't heard of any trade talks involving Soucy. However, he could still draw interest from teams attempting to load up on blue-line depth before the trade deadline.
The St. Louis Blues remain in the hunt for a wild-card berth in the Western Conference, but they are still dogged by trade rumors.
Most of the speculation centers on team captain Brayden Schenn, who was No. 7 on our previous trade block big board.
Previous reports indicated the Blues were listening to offer for the 33-year-old, but they weren't actively shopping him. He's stated that management hasn't asked him to waive his no-trade clause.
The two-way center wouldn't be a playoff rental player. He has three more seasons on his contract with an average annual value of $6.5 million. Interested clubs might attempt to persuade the Blues to retain up to half of that cap hit, but that will only raise their asking price.
Friedman and the Toronto Sun's Terry Koshan reported Sunday that Schenn was on the Toronto Maple Leafs' radar. With the Blues staying in the playoff hunt, TSN's Darren Dreger believes it's unlikely they'll trade their captain.
Perched near the bottom of the Eastern Conference standings, the Pittsburgh Penguins are on the verge of missing the playoffs for the third straight season.
And some observers believe general manager Kyle Dubas will be a seller at the trade deadline.
The GM already made a significant move earlier this season, shipping Marcus Pettersson and Drew O'Connor to the Vancouver Canucks on Feb. 1. Trade speculation has been swirling of late around defenseman Erik Karlsson, and winger Rickard Rakell has also emerged as a trade candidate.
The 31-year-old is making his debut here. He's in the third season of a six-year contract with an average annual value of $5 million and an eight-team no-trade list. A scorer who can play center or wing, he had 28 goals and 52 points in 62 games this season.
On Feb. 28, Vensel of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette suggested Rickard had the best trade value. The Penguins aren't in a hurry to move him, but they could listen if they get an offer that exceeds what they received in the Pettersson trade.
Philadelphia Flyers forward Scott Laughton rose to No. 6 on our previous NHL trade block big board.
His ability to play center or wing, two-way style, leadership and affordable $3 million annual cap hit through 2025-26 made him among the most attractive players in the trade market.
The Flyers have fielded trade calls about Laughton for weeks. However, the factors that make him an enticing trade target also make him invaluable to his current team. On Feb. 27, Kevin Kurz of The Athletic reported team sources were concerned his departure would adversely affect the club's culture and morale.
Kurz indicated the Flyers are seeking a first-round draft pick or a prospect equivalent for the 30-year-old forward. He lacks no-trade protection, but the team would let him determine his destination if it moved him. Kurz believes the Maple Leafs would be a likely landing spot for the Toronto native.
On March 1, Kurz reported a team source said no deal was imminent for Laughton. While that could change by Friday, the growing likelihood of the Flyers retaining him drops him down on our current list.
Sitting at No. 3 on our previous trade board, Brock Boeser has been discussing a new contract with the Vancouver Canucks. However, it remains to be seen if they'll re-sign or trade the winger by the deadline.
The 28-year-old is completing a three-year contract with an average annual value of $6.7 million and a 10-team no-trade list. He had a career-best performance with 40 goals and 73 points in 2023-24 but has managed 18 goals and 36 points in 53 games this season.
According to Daily Faceoff's Seravalli (stick tap to Canucks Army), Boeser rejected a five-year, $40 million offer because he seeks a longer-term deal.
Seravalli believes they'll make one final pitch to him. If he rejects it, they'll consider trade options or keep him as an "own rental" for the playoffs.
In our previous board, we noted speculation suggesting the Canucks could retain Boeser as an "own rental." However, Patrick Johnston of the Vancouver Province felt it was more likely he would get traded. Friedman believes both sides are open to all options, including a trade.
The Seattle Kraken are already acting like sellers, having traded Oliver Bjorkstrand and Yanni Gourde on Wednesday in a three-team deal involving Tampa Bay and Detroit that landed them a pair of first-round picks.
Impending unrestricted free agent Brandon Tanev, who sat at No. 12 on our previous trade block big board, could be next.
On Feb. 28, TSN's Pierre LeBrun reported Tanev had drawn interest from playoff contenders and some bubble teams. The 33-year-old winger is UFA-eligible this season with a $3.5 million cap hit and a 10-team no-trade list. According to LeBrun, they're prepared to retain half of his cap hit to facilitate a trade.
One of those contenders could be the Vegas Golden Knights. Danny Webster of the Las Vegas Review-Journal included Tanev on his list of potential trade targets.
The Chicago Blackhawks made a major trade last Saturday when they shipped defenseman Seth Jones to the Florida Panthers.
They were also part of the Jan. 24 blockbuster three-team trade involving Mikko Rantanen, sending winger Taylor Hall to the Carolina Hurricanes.
Chicago general manager Kyle Davidson could make more moves before the deadline. He could be entertaining inquiries about Ryan Donato, who was at No. 4 on our previous trade board.
The 28-year-old is finishing a two-year contract with an affordable $2 million cap hit. He's having a career-best performance in his contract year, with 22 goals and 23 assists for 45 points in 59 games.
Contenders seeking middle-six forward depth could be interested in Donato. Webster included him on his list of proposed trade candidates for the Golden Knights. Johnston and LeBrun had him on their list of Winnipeg Jets' trade targets.
As the New York Islanders struggle to remain in the playoff race, speculation abounds over whether general manager Lou Lamoriello will be a buyer or a seller.
Most of the conjecture is focused on UFA-eligible center Brock Nelson, but he's not the only trade chip the Isles have as the deadline approaches.
Winger Kyle Palmieri is also eligible to become an UFA on July 1. He is completing a four-year contract with an annual cap hit of $5 million. He's reached the 20-goal plateau this season for the seventh time in his career, sitting fourth among the Islanders' leading scorers with 41 points.
The 34-year-old can be a streaky scorer at times, but he's a hard-working forward whose experience could be invaluable to playoff clubs in need of scoring depth.
The Fourth Period's Dave Pagnotta believes the Los Angeles Kings could be a suitable destination for Palmieri. Other possibilities could include the Columbus Blue Jackets or a return to his former team, the New Jersey Devils.
Editor's Note: Smith was traded to the Vegas Golden Knights on Thursday
The New York Rangers have been among the busiest teams in the trade market. Since Dec. 6, they have traded Jacob Trouba to the Anaheim Ducks, sent Kaapo Kakko to the Seattle Kraken for Will Borgen, acquired J.T. Miller from the Vancouver Canucks, and shipped Ryan Lindgren and Jimmy Vesey to the Colorado Avalanche.
And general manager Chris Drury might not be finished making deals. On March 2, The Athletic's Arthur Staple speculated winger Reilly Smith could be next on the trade block. They've since made him a healthy scratch for "roster management" reasons, which means they're working on sending him to another team.
The Rangers acquired Smith last July from the Pittsburgh Penguins, who retained $1.3 million of his $5 million cap hit for this season. He's slated to become an unrestricted free agent on July. A six-time 50-plus point scorer, the 33-year-old winger has struggled this season, with 29 points in 58 games.
With over $15 million in projected trade-deadline cap space, the Rangers can retain part of their share of Smith's cap hit to boost his trade value. His scoring ability and playoff experience with the Vegas Golden Knights (including a Stanley Cup in 2023) could draw interest from contenders seeking depth on the wing.
The New York Islanders are struggling to remain in the Eastern Conference playoff race. That's making it difficult for general manager Lou Lamoriello to start selling off pending free agents such as Brock Nelson, who was No. 2 on our previous trade block big board.
The 33-year-old center is in the final season of a six-year contract with an annual cap hit of $6 million. He also has a 16-team no-trade list. A three-time 30-plus goal scorer, his production is down this season with 19 goals and 41 points, but his experience and two-way skills make him a prized trade commodity.
LeBrun reported on Feb. 27 there was no clear indication the Islanders would make Nelson available. The picture was no clearer on March 4 when Staple cited a source indicating all options remain on the table, including a trade or a contract extension.
The Colorado Avalanche, Dallas Stars, New Jersey Devils, Toronto Maple Leafs and Winnipeg Jets were listed as potential trade destinations for Nelson in our previous trade board. It will be interesting to see if he ends up joining one of those clubs by the deadline.
Carolina Hurricanes winger Mikko Rantanen topped our previous NHL Trade Block Big Board. He was acquired from the Colorado Avalanche on Jan. 24, but it's uncertain if he'll re-sign with the Hurricanes, ensuring he remains as our top trade candidate heading toward the deadline.
A proven playoff performer, the 28-year-old has two 100-point seasons under his belt and had 64 points in 49 games with the Avalanche before the trade to the Hurricanes. He's struggled somewhat in Carolina with six points in 11 games.
Seravalli reported there were ongoing negotiations between the winger and Carolina management. If the Hurricanes decide to trade him, they'll want a return that improves their chances of winning the Stanley Cup. Otherwise, they'll retain him as an "own rental" for the rest of the season.
Johnston reported the Hurricanes told several teams interested in Rantanen that they weren't shopping him but to circle back near the trade deadline if he remained unsigned. On Saturday, Friedman reported it's unlikely the Finn will decide if he'll re-sign by Friday.
Friedman said Rantanen is still dealing with being traded by the Avalanche and has had little time to adjust to his new city and team. The 'Canes must decide whether to keep him and hope he'll re-sign before July 1 or flip him to another team by Friday.
Rantanen's skills and Stanley Cup experience ensure he remains atop our trade board. The Hurricanes carry half of his $9.3 million cap hit ($4.63 million) and could retain half of that to facilitate a trade if they decide to move him before the deadline.

TITLE: Novak Djokovic Not Dealing with Injury Despite Viral Video, Will Play BNP Paribas Open
DATE: 
URL: https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25167690-novak-djokovic-not-dealing-injury-despite-viral-video-will-play-bnp-paribas-open
CONTENT:
Novak Djokovic told reporters that he is not dealing with an injury despite a video showing him limping into an airport a few weeks ago, and he added that he's "feeling good" and planning to play the Sunshine Double (BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells and Miami Open).
"It was really, yeah, awkward to see that video, because I arrived to the airport and I hit myself really badly as I was walking out, because it was very early, I think, 4 or 5 a.m. I was just limping because I hit myself badly in the ankle," Djokovic said, per ESPN.com's D'Arcy Maine.
"That's all. It was just a hit. It was nothing else. But then people connected it to the injury and thought it was something escalating and coming back.
"But anyway, I'm feeling good. I really look forward coming to Indian Wells and Miami this year. I'll play the Sunshine Double first time after, I think, six years."
Djokovic suffered a muscle tear in his left hamstring that forced him to retire after one set in the Australian Open semifinals against Alexander Zverev on Jan. 13.
He didn't compete again until Feb. 17 in the Round of 32 at the Qatar Open. Djokovic fell to Matteo Berrettini in straight sets.
The aforementioned video showed Djokovic heading into the airport following that tournament.
Djokovic, who will be coached by Andy Murray for both events, will play the winner of Botic van de Zandschulp and Nick Kyrgios in the Round of 64 at Indian Wells on Saturday.

TITLE: Seahawks GM Addresses DK Metcalf Trade Rumors: 'We’re Talking To a Ton of Teams'
DATE: 
URL: https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25167651-seahawks-gm-addresses-dk-metcalf-trade-rumors-were-talking-ton-teams
CONTENT:
Seattle Seahawks general manager John Schneider confirmed that the team has fielded several trade offers regarding star wide receiver DK Metcalf.
"We’re talking to a ton of teams, taking offers, seeing what that looks like," Schneider said on his weekly KIRO-AM radio show, via Michael-Shawn Dugar of The Athletic.
He didn't completely shut the door on Metcalf possibly remaining with the Seahawks in 2025, though.
"He understands we’re going to head down this road, we’re going to do the best thing we can for the organization, and if things don’t fall the way he wants, there’s a good chance he could end up being here," Schneider said. "And at that point, we all turn the corner and move forward. Through this whole process, he’s been extremely professional and respectful."
NFL Network's Tom Pelissero and Ian Rapoport reported Wednesday that Metcalf requested a trade, with Seattle agreeing to "explore options.
The request came after "a series of conversations over the past two weeks" between both sides, per ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Schefter also noted that Metcalf "prefers" to be dealt to a team with contending aspirations.
The 27-year-old has one season remaining on a three-year contract worth $72 million that he signed with Seattle in 2022. He'll carry a cap hit of just under $31.9 million for the 2025 season, via Spotrac.
It's easy to see why the Seahawks may choose to retain Metcalf if they don't feel that there are acceptable offers from opposing teams, as their wide receiver depth is already thin after releasing veteran Tyler Lockett on Wednesday.
Still, several organizations already seem to be targeting Metcalf.
Rapoport listed the Las Vegas Raiders, Los Angeles Chargers, New England Patriots and Houston Texans as teams to "keep an eye on" regarding the receiver.
Metcalf fell just shy of recording his third consecutive season with at least 1,000 receiving yards in 2024, racking up 66 catches for 992 yards and five touchdowns in 15 appearances.
The two-time Pro Bowl wideout has surpassed 900 receiving yards in all six years of his career.
Seattle will continue negotiations with interested front offices as the offseason progresses, but Metcalf isn't guaranteed to experience a change of scenery before the start of the 2025 season.

TITLE: Klay Thompson's Dad Mychal Says Mavs SF 'in Purgatory' After Luka Trade, Kyrie Injury
DATE: 
URL: https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25167643-klay-thompsons-dad-mychal-says-mavs-sf-purgatory-after-luka-trade-kyrie-injury
CONTENT:
Klay Thompson's experience with the Dallas Mavericks hasn't been what the four-time champion signed up for this offseason.
The Mavs traded star Luka Dončić and have since dealt with an injury to his replacement, Anthony Davis, as well as Kyrie Irving, Daniel Gafford, Derrick Lively and others.
Amid what has been a frustrating stretch for Dallas, Thompson's father, Mychal, spoke candidly about what Thompson's time has been like with the Mavericks.
"He thought with Luka and Kyrie that he had a chance to get back to the Finals," Mychal Thompson said. "Obviously Luka left, but I told him, 'Well AD's coming, you still got a chance to get to the Finals.' Because AD is that good, but then he's hurt. And then Gafford got hurt, then Lively got hurt. So yeah, he's stuck in purgatory right now. If they hang on to the 10th seed, that will be the story of the year in the NBA. I think they're going to lose 10 in a row."
Davis had a promising debut after being traded to Dallas, but he suffered an adductor strain in his first game. The injury has left him sidelined for several weeks now, but he reportedly could opt to sit out the rest of the year and head into the offseason healthy.
Irving suffered a torn ACL earlier this week, ending his season prematurely.
A playoff run is still in the realm of possibility without Irving, but if Davis decides not to come back this year, it's hard to imagine the Mavericks could even make the postseason.
Dallas is currently sitting in 10th place in the West at 32-31 with just 19 games remaining this year.
