TITLE: Wildfires are making their way east—where they could be much deadlier
DATE: 
URL: https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/wildfires-east-cities-climate-change
CONTENT:
We all know wildfires have been getting worse in the drought-stricken western U.S., but experts say the growing risk on the east coast is concerning.
When we think of wildfires, we often think of western states like California where massive blazes, such as the fires that burned in and around Los Angeles earlier this year. But more than 100 fires recently burned through North and South Carolina amid dry and windy conditions.
While California and other western states face a high wildfire risk, the west is less densely populated and fires often arise in the wilderness. Not so in the eastern and southern United States, where population density puts more people and property at risk. According to the U.S. Census, 56 percent of the U.S. population lives in the eastern and southern regions of the country, compared to just 24 percent in the West.
New research shows that there may be cause for concern in the East as well, where fire size, numbers, and total area burned seem to be increasing.
Published in Geophysical Research Letters last year, researchers used data collected over a 36-year period to show that large wildfire numbers doubled from 2005-2018, compared to the two decades prior. The biggest increases were seen in the Southern Coastal Plains of Florida, portions of coastal Georgia, and South Carolina where the five largest wildfires occurred. Significant wildfires were also common in the Central Appalachian Mountains of Tennessee, West Virginia, and Virginia.
Conversely, wildfire numbers decreased in the northeastern U.S. as shifting climactic conditions led to more precipitation.
The goal of the study was to identify whether wildfires were growing in frequency and scope, not to show what was causing this increase. But the authors speculate that warmer, drier conditions brought on by a changing climate combined with a lack of prescribed fires has led to a proliferation of woodier plants, trees, and shrubs that provide the fuel for fires to burn in greater strength and numbers.
“This makes for wildfire conditions that are much more difficult for us to suppress,” says Victoria Donovan, lead author of the study and an ecologist at the University of Florida’s West Florida Research and Education Center in Milton, Florida.
Invasive species like Cogongrass, a perennial weed capable of driving wildfires deeper into the forest, have also taken over large swaths of the South, across Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida.
The grass increases the instances of wildfires because, once ignited, it burns hotter and faster and regrows more rapidly than native grasses.
While the fires aren’t as large as they are in the West, the risk to humans is much greater.
“In the East we have a greater wildlife-urban interface, where we’ve seen more people intermingling with wild land vegetation,” says Donovan.
The study points to examples like the 2016 Gatlinburg fire in Tennessee, which, although less than a tenth of the size of the Camp Fire, destroyed nearly 2,500 structures and killed 14 people. When wildfires ignite in densely populated areas, they not only increase the risk of a loss of life, but also become harder to defend.
Additionally, the danger of wildfire smoke extends much farther than just the immediate area of the fire and can impact more people in the eastern U.S. Last year’s Canadian wildfires, for example, placed more than a third of the U.S. population under air quality advisories.
The study also found that 85 percent of wildfires were caused by humans, a statistic which isn’t surprising to Volker Radeloff, a forestry professor at the University of Wisconsin Madison who was not involved in the study.
He says that when fires happen in populated areas, the risk of human ignition increases. People can start fires for any number of reasons, and in populated areas it puts the landscape at risk. They might be burning dead leaves in their backyard, and it gets out of hand—or, in the case of the Gatlinburg fire, two teenage boys playing with matches set the land ablaze.
“In these areas where houses and wildlife vegetation intermingle it’s kind of a double whammy because when a fire occurs lots of houses are at risk, you have to evacuate people, and there’s also more people to start fires either intentionally or unintentionally,” says Radeloff.
While the study did show that the number of wildfires in the past four decades have increased, it’s challenging to point to trends because in the East, there’s still so much variability in the weather from year to year, says Loretta Mickley, a senior climate research fellow at Harvard, who was not involved in the study.
“There will be one huge fire one year and then not much in the years to follow. You’re left wondering whether it’s a bad year or a trend,” she says.
Similarly, it's unclear whether wildfires burning in North and South Carolina are part of a possible trend.
While in the West you can see a clear upward trend in fires as precipitation decreases and temperatures increase, in the East the weather is less predictable. In an El Niño year, for example, the distribution of rainfall in the South and East may quell the risk of wildfires.
She says that the study is an “important first step” in showing us where we need to be taking care to protect the landscape.
And no matter whether it’s a trend or not, the numbers are concerning. “Right now, it’s safe to say that in the Eastern U.S. there are quite a few eco-regions that have had more fires in the last five to 10 years than in the decades before that,” says Radeloff.

TITLE: The 'least spectacular' of the Great Lakes is a devastating snow machine
DATE:

CONTENT:
Lake Erie's devastating lake-effect snow storms can smother communities with collapsed roofs and impassable roads. Could these storms get worse?
Ashtabula, Ohio — Jim Timonere has been watching and waiting for Lake Erie to freeze over, just to catch a break.
It’s been a brutal winter for communities along the southeastern and eastern shores of Lake Erie that spans Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York.
Last Thanksgiving Day weekend, the region was paralyzed by a “historic” storm that saw almost six feet of snow upend life across hundreds of miles.
“When I woke up at 3 a.m. to check the snowfall I thought: ‘no big deal,’” he recalls.
“Two hours later, I looked outside, and it was: ‘Oh, my god.’ We got feet of snow in a matter of hours.”
Roofs of more than a dozen structures in Ashtabula collapsed, including the local high school’s, forcing hundreds of students to take online classes for a month.
“We’re used to the eight inches of snow. We can handle that,” says Timonere, then and now the city manager for a town of nearly 18,000 people.
“(But) when you start talking feet, and two to three inches in an hour, nobody can keep up with that.”
By many measures, Lake Erie is the least spectacular of the five Great Lakes— it’s the shallowest, smallest by volume, and farthest south.
But it’s creating dangerous snow conditions for millions of people from Cleveland, Ohio to Buffalo, New York and beyond.
While snowfall across much of America’s upper Midwest has been below average this winter, the opposite is playing out in regions downwind of the Great Lakes.
Twice so far this winter, residents along Lake Erie’s southeastern and eastern shorelines have experienced record snow storms, resulting in the national guard being mobilized and snow emergencies declared.
Paradoxically, some evidence suggests our warming planet could lead to more major snow events for communities downwind of the Great Lakes.
When cold air moving south from the Arctic and Canada passes over lakes that have been heated throughout the summer and fall, it creates conditions for fast water evaporation into the atmosphere that then can lead to massive, fast-falling snow dumps.
(Canada's beloved outdoor ice rinks are melting away. Read more.)
Because it’s shallow—just 210 feet at its deepest point—water temperatures in Lake Erie can increase rapidly during the summer and fall months. Since record keeping began in 1927, the Lake’s water temperatures have been rising. Throughout the 1950s, a thermometer submerged at Buffalo, New York, recorded temperatures at or below 69˚F for 28 days in the month of August. The past decade saw that happen on just two days, when the average temperature rose to 74˚F.
Those warming waters have resulted in record low ice cover in recent winters; on the first day of 2025, Lake Erie was still ice-free, though a subsequent cool down saw much of the Lake freeze over later this winter. These warm conditions create the perfect ingredients for heavy snowfall.
“On some level, compared to the past, (the lake-effect snow has been) extraordinary, this winter in particular. It’s because of how warm the lakes have been,” says Richard ‘Ricky’ Rood, professor emeritus at the University of Michigan who runs Open Climate, a website that collects and shares climate science lesson plans.
“What we’re seeing this year is the fact that the Lakes are staying warm, relatively ice-free far later into the winter season, and you still have cold air outbreaks,” says Rood.
A study published in the Journal of Climate in 2003 found “a statistically significant increasing trend in snowfall for the lake-effect sites” throughout the 20th century across all Great Lakes. And another study looking at Buffalo, New York and published in the journal Earth’s Future last June found that the conditions that produce lake-effect snow could produce 14 percent more precipitation as the planet warms, though some of that may fall as rain.
Modeling by the Great Lakes Integrated Sciences and Assessments (GLISA) program suggests that air temperatures in the region could rise by up to 11˚F by 2100, a change that would create warmer lake water as years of warmer weather unfold.
Given the complex relationship between Arctic air flows and changing climate patterns, experts say they can’t predict with certainty what future snowfall around the Great Lakes will look like, though the ingredients for severe snow storms—warming lake surface water and shots of extremely cold Arctic air—are likely to continue.
“The frequency of air crossing the Great Lakes that is cold enough to produce lake-effect snow is likely decreasing on average,” says David Kristovich of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign’s department of climate, meteorology, and atmospheric sciences.
“However, it is difficult to envision a situation where occasional, extreme, relatively cold air outbreaks producing intense short-term lake-effect rains or snows stop occurring,” he adds.
It’s not only Great Lakes residents who could face dangerous lake-effect snow in the years ahead. Warmer water has led to more sea- and lake-effect snow storms abroad, with trends documented in Istanbul and in cities downwind of the Sea of Japan.
In January, lake-effect snow was reported along the United States Gulf Coast.
Overall, winters are getting warmer, but cold air outbreaks will still occur, resulting in fewer, but more severe, storms. In January, for example, the Erie region of Pennsylvania recorded an average amount of snowfall for the month, but half of that fell in just three days.
“Since the climate is actively warming, what we’re doing now is starting to sample this warming climate,” says Rood. “Do not treat these as a one-off event.”
(From our September 2020 issue: The Great Lakes depend on ice. What happens when they barely freeze?)
JoAnn Vranek, a retired English teacher who has lived in Ashtabula for decades, says she wasn’t able to get out of her house during the Thanksgiving weekend storm, and had to hire a snow removal contractor to clear her driveway.
“I got a good deal (but) others on my street had to pay hundreds of dollars to hire people,” she says.
“The house next to me, her eaves and flashing came down. She’s going to have to get that fixed. I don’t ever remember that happening before.”
The local high school building where Vranek once worked and which was built less than 20 years ago at a cost of nearly $40 million, remains closed due to the snow-induced roof collapse. Authorities say it may be a year before all students are back on campus.
The Thanksgiving storm also put major strain on critical services in Ashtabula.
Timonere says the city’s emergency services struggled to reach people, some of whom faced high carbon monoxide readings in their homes after furnace vents were blocked by snow. One local township had to deploy a water tanker truck to put out a fire because fire hydrants were buried under the snow and fire crews couldn’t find them.
“For small communities like us, we don’t have an abundance of funds to deal with this,” he says.
“I don’t have 20 guys I can put on the roads when we get snow like this, like the big cities might have.”
He recommends residents in the path of lake-effect snowstorms have contractors inspect their roofs.
Yue Li, a professor of engineering at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, says that adapting to heavier snow storms will require serious upgrades.
“Cities will need to design neighborhoods with better snow drainage systems, integrating snow storage areas (and) reviewing building standards, especially for roofs, to ensure they can withstand heavy snow loads,” he says.
“Expanding access to snow removal equipment, storage sites, and backup supplies like salt and sand is vital for maintaining mobility and safety.”
Ashtabula is embarking on a $100 million plan to upgrade its water treatment and wastewater infrastructure, and community leaders now find themselves taking flooding from rain and heavy snow events into account.
“Hopefully this was an anomaly, but like we’ve said,” says Timonere, “the weather is changing and there’s no denying it anymore.”

TITLE: Marine engineers: Five species that shape underwater ecosystems
DATE: 
URL: https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/paid-content-marine-engineers-5-species-that-shape-underwater-ecosystems
CONTENT:
Among the myriad creatures that populate our ocean, some stand out as having an outsized impact on the marine environment—shaping and maintaining habitats that themselves sustain countless other forms of life.
Ecosystem engineers are species whose behaviors help build, modify and maintain an array of underwater worlds. None of these creatures are impacting our ocean like human beings, however. Which is why Prada Group, together with UNESCO-IOC, created the SEA BEYOND educational program—which benefits from 1 percent of the proceeds from the Prada Re-Nylon for SEA BEYOND Collection—that teaches ocean literacy in schools around the world. The hope is to inspire a new generation of ocean custodians to discover creatures like the ones described below. And in understanding them, feel an urgent need to protect them.
Coral polyps are among the greatest builders on our planet. From the tropics to the Arctic, these tiny creatures spend thousands of years patiently constructing the largest living structures on Earth. Corals are actually microscopic animals that enjoy a symbiotic relationship with tiny algae called zooxanthellae. The corals provide the zooxanthellae with the carbon dioxide and water they need to photosynthesize, while the zooxanthellae supply the building blocks of sugars and proteins the corals need in order to secrete the calcium carbonate that forms the building materials of the vast three dimensional ‘cities’ that account for approximately 1 percent of the ocean floor, yet support approximately 25 percent of all marine species. Coral reefs provide more than just shelter though—they modify the flow of water and influence wave patterns, distributing nutrients and larvae, especially in the tropics. They also provide coastal barriers that protect coasts from storm surges and erosion. Find a human architect or engineer who can do all of that!
Unlike most sharks, whale sharks are filter feeders, a trait they share with that other ocean behemoth, the whale. These gentle giants cycle vast amounts of nutrients through their feeding habits and as such play a crucial role in regulating marine microbes like plankton, as well as chemicals like nitrogen that support all life in the ocean. Whale sharks spend most of their lives migrating vast distances between feeding grounds and in doing so they deposit vital nutrients through their excrement, which in turn fertilizes phytoplankton blooms, helping to regulate the spread of these crucial microorganisms across different biogeographical zones, as well as through the water column. Research shows that whale sharks routinely dive to depths below 3,200 feet (1,000 meters), vertically blending nutrients by feeding on krill in deep waters, before excreting them closer to the surface. This fertilizing activity, which is shared by many cetaceans, is known as the “whale pump,” or in some circles “the poop loop,” and supports the entire web of life in the ocean. Whale sharks also help regulate fish populations by preventing any single species from dominating the ecosystem.
Deep sea mussels are not like the mussels you might enjoy in a white wine, butter, and lemon juice sauce. Unlike their shallow water counterparts, deep sea mussels live and die in the lightless depths of the ocean, between 1,600 feet (500 meters) and close to 10,000 feet (3,000 meters) underwater. Their preferred habitat is in close proximity to hydrothermal vents that spew water laden with chemicals that are toxic to human beings, but provide the mussels with the compounds they need to create energy. Over time, they gather in dense colonies that can cover thousands of square feet of the sea bed, forming complex three-dimensional habitats, not unlike reefs, that provide shelter for a wide variety of deep sea species. The deep-sea bivalves act like a vast filtration system, modifying the chemical composition of the water around the vents so that it is more habitable. Like corals, they are symbiotes, hosting tiny bacteria that assist them with metabolic conversions, as well as protecting them from viruses and other harmful bacteria.
They may lack the charisma of corals, but blow lugworms (Arenicola marina) play a crucial role in shaping both underwater and terrestrial topographies. They are not unlike earthworms, except instead of soil, they process sediment through a combination of burrowing and feeding that is known as bioturbation. These activities form funnels in the sand that facilitate the transfer of oxygen and help prevent sand from clogging. At the same time, the lugworms literally “eat” the sand, extracting tiny microorganisms and organic matter as they ingest it. They then pop their tails just above the surface and excrete the processed sand, creating the distinctive tiny coils that can be seen across beaches all over the world. Yes, these coils are lugworm poops. At the same time, lugworm burrows provide habitats for other species, while the entire intertidal ecosystem is made more habitable thanks to their filtering activities.
If you’ve ever dived or snorkeled a coral reef, chances are you will have encountered these champions of marine industry. And if you’ve ever set foot on a tropical beach, then you’ve witnessed the outcome of their hard work. Parrotfish—so named for their colorful livery and powerful beaks—are literally able to create beaches. They do so by feeding on the algae that grow inside coral polyps, inadvertently ingesting huge amounts of calcium carbonate in the process. Their digestive systems then convert the coral skeleton into fine white sand. They are voracious eaters and can take 20 bites of coral in a minute—making them prolific excreters, too. It’s estimated that a single parrotfish can generate nearly 2,000 pounds (900 kilograms) of sand in a year. Scientists believe they play a key role in shaping coastal ecosystems around coral reefs, even helping to form coral atolls.
Through SEA BEYOND, Prada Group and UNESCO-IOC have reached almost 35,000 students from 184 schools and 56 countries around the world, investigating the connection between the ocean and climate and related environmental challenges.

TITLE: Are these the last days of Brazil's realm of hidden wonder?
DATE: 
URL: https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/brazil-cerrado-tropical-savanna-conservation
CONTENT:
The largest agricultural boom on the planet threatens to destroy a spectacular savanna. Here's what happens when progress outpaces preservation.
It’s called the Cerrado, Portuguese for ‘closed,’ and for nearly all of human historythis vast tropical savanna in central Brazil seems to have been shut off from the rest of the world. People do live there; hunter-gatherer groups, overcoming the formidable wilds, have roamed the Cerrado since the Stone Age. And in colonial times, those escaping slavery often disappeared behind the hills, where they built tight-knit communities, unlocked the land’s subtle gifts, and settled in. Otherwise, across centuries, hardly anyone ventured inside.
The terrain was repellent to visitors, practically impossible to traverse. Much of the Cerrado is a dense, tangled mess of stunted trees and shrubs, the whole place crawling with snakes. It pales in lushness to the mighty Amazon rainforest to the north, the green lungs of the Earth. Even some scientists who study the Cerrado call it ugly; the common term for its scrubland is —“dirty field.”
But the main reason the Cerrado was ignored beyond Indigenous peoples and those seeking refuge is that no one could find money in it—no hardwoods, no diamonds, no oil. The soil is highly acidic, deadly to most non-native plants, and during the six-month dry season the land is often ravaged by fire. Until the mid-20th century, the Cerrado was dismissed by the capitalist world as a wasteland. Best to leave it closed and move on.
(The paradise in Brazil you don’t know—yet.)
In the 1950s, Brazil found a use for it. The nation, leaping into the global economy, decided to construct a new capital city, a monument to Brazilian progress, in the center of the country. So a hunk of the Cerrado, smack in the middle, was cleared, and Brasília rose up. Five million people now live there; only São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte are bigger.
Then, in the 1970s, came a more sweeping transformation. Brazilian agricultural scientists working in a government lab cooked up a fertilizer, packed with lime, that modified the harsh Cerrado soil and enabled cash crops to grow. Industrial watering systems could counteract the dry season, and fire brigades would snuff out the flames. The Cerrado was open for business.
Bulldozers and tractors rolled in, and thousands of square miles of scrubby Cerrado were scraped clean. Corn, sugarcane, and especially soybeans were planted, then trucked across the country to seaports. China, the United States, and Europe bought them up, and the land clearing intensified. The largest agricultural corporations in the world established massive factory farms there. The Brazilian economy roared. More land was churned up; there seemed no limit: The Cerrado’s size is Texas times three. The area, according to a 2021 report from the World Bank, has “the greatest agricultural potential on the planet.”

Along with government workers and farmhands, a new generation of biologists, many lured by the science department at the University of Brasília, also came to the Cerrado, curious about this relatively unknown region, always considered less worthy of study than the Amazon. Over the past two decades, scientific attention has focused on the area even as it has shifted toward becoming an ecological “sacrifice zone”—what land-use experts call a place, lacking strong environmental protection, that caters to human consumption. And the Cerrado’s great secrets have emerged.
Turning away most humans for millennia appears to have been an ideal strategy for preserving extraordinary biodiversity. The Cerrado, researchers from the University of Brasília and elsewhere have tallied, is home to more than 11,000 species of plants and trees, 40 percent of which exist nowhere else. There are 800 bird species, 1,200 fish species, and 90,000 insect species. The golden-furred, stilt-legged maned wolf prowls the Cerrado, as does the giant anteater, which grows up to seven feet long, not including its two-foot tongue. There are wide populations of bees, snakes, lizards, bats, and butterflies. About 5 percent of Earth’s animal and plant species are thought to live in the Cerrado, the biologically richest savanna in the world.
(Discover all 25 of the best places to visit in 2025, including the Cerrado.)
The real secret, though, is what you can’t observe. The soil in the Cerrado runs deep, in places 80 feet, and to help survive the dry season and its fires, many plants sprout extensive root systems. The vast majority of the Cerrado’s biomass is subterranean. Some trees that look like spindly fence posts aboveground are muscle-rooted and brawny below. Biologists who examine this hidden realm call the Cerrado the upside-down forest.
This underground world performs priceless ecological services. It’s a massive carbon sink, locking away billions of tons of carbon dioxide in well-buried roots. As the Cerrado is converted to farmland—the current rate is more than 4,000 acres a day—the greenhouse gas is released. Each year, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the discharge due to altering the Cerrado is equivalent to the annual emissions of 50 million cars. If all the carbon held by the Cerrado were discharged, this might single-handedly push global warming over the 1.5-degree Celsius limit set by the United Nations at the Paris climate conference of 2015, a point at which the global ice sheets could inexorably melt, causing the seas to inundate every coastal city.
Deep soil is also a sponge. The Cerrado collects and stores seasonal rains in immense subterranean chambers. The more land that’s cut above, the less water held below. These aquifers, geologists report, feed the headwaters of eight of the 12 major river basins in South America. The Cerrado’s underground tanks pump water all over the continent. If the Amazon is the lungs, the Cerrado is the heart.
(Another weapon to fight climate change? Put carbon back where we found it.)
To get to a place where the Cerrado’s pulse can be experienced untamed and raw, take the road north out of Brasília. It first runs arrow straight through the suburbs, then direct to the factory farms. Rows of soybeans roll to the horizons; grain trucks outnumber cars. Tractors spray the fields with white mist. More than 150 million gallons of pesticides, Brazilian environmental journalists report, douse the Cerrado each year. “The land has been decimated,” says Brazilian ecologist Paulo Oliveira, editor of The Cerrados of Brazil, a book that explores the natural history of the region. And soybeans, for the most part, aren’t eaten by people—they’re shipped around the globe to feed cattle. The world demands beef.
After a couple of hours of driving, the windshield spattered with bugs, hills rise up, the giant farms dissipate, and the Cerrado exists in a natural state. The terrain, admittedly, can appear weird. Soil toxicity meddles with tree growth, making the trunks all gnarled and hunched. The frequent fires scorch the buds at the ends of branches, which are replaced by lower buds that grow at contorted angles, then those eventually get fire-burned too, and so on. It’s basically a big thicket of elbows.
Though not every Cerrado landscape looks Dr. Seuss strange. The Cerrado is one huge, interconnected biome composed of a dozen varieties of smaller ecosystems, ranging from open grassland to dense, full-size woods. Driving deeper in, some 150 miles from Brasília, travelers approach Chapada dos Veadeiros, one of the national parks in the Cerrado, where sections of closed-canopy forest shroud tumbling rivers. There’s a tourist town here, Alto Paraíso—High Paradise—where a steady stream of visitors, primarily from other parts of Brazil, hire certified hiking guides, lounge in streams, and purchase genuine Cerrado crystals, from pendant-necklace size to paperweight, dug from the ancient soil and perfect, say the shopkeepers, for cleansing your aura.
(Learn more about tapirs.)
(Volunteers coming to rescue animals injured during Brazil's wildfires.)
This is where the battle for the Cerrado is being waged, between those who cherish the otherworldly place as it is and those bending the land to their will. Less than 10 percent of the Cerrado falls under any environmental protection, mostly state parks and mixed-use areas where people live and grow crops. Only 3 percent is under full federal preservation. The national parks are just specks in the vastness. By comparison, about half of the Amazon biome is protected—and the Amazon is specifically named in the Brazilian Constitution as a national heritage zone, but not the Cerrado. An estimated four-fifths of the entire Cerrado has already been disturbed by human activities, almost everything happening in the past 50 years. No one knows how many unique species of plants or animals have already been lost.
(Explore the mystery and wonder of the Amazon in this interactive special issue.)
International conservation organizations like WWF and Global Witness, as well as Brazilian groups such as the National Campaign in Defense of the Cerrado, have mobilized. They seek to spread awareness of the Cerrado and its precarious situation and implore the Brazilian government to safeguard what’s left. A team of Brazilian forestry scientists, in a notable 2017 paper, demonstrated that the Cerrado’s essential ground layers, which contain most of the endemic species, are painfully slow at self-repair; a section of cleared land that had been abandoned for more than 20 years hardly seemed to regenerate much biodiversity.
At times, Brazilian legislators seem receptive to the idea that consumption and conservation can exist hand in hand. The same government lab that originally developed the fertilizer that fueled the Cerrado’s cultivation has now been tasked with creating an improved version to significantly increase crop yield, so economic growth can be maintained without surrendering more land. Technology can both harm us and save us, the great roulette wheel of the modern world. So far, progress has been modest, with the leaders of Brazil more actively enforcing environmental protections to slow the rate of deforestation. Meanwhile, plenty of historic grassland continues to be plowed over. There appears to be a reluctance among legislators to enact regulations that will likely harm finances.
And the agribusiness, undeniably, is helping keep the economy of Brazil, and the globe, rolling along. At the same time, the National Campaign in Defense of the Cerrado and science journalists have reported about the particularly convenient and widespread belief that nothing is really being lost—agricultural lobbyists have indicated to legislators that the Cerrado’s last untouched places are little but infertile, uninhabited regions just waiting to turn a profit.

Luciana Santos begs to differ. She was born in the Cerrado and lives there still, with her husband and four young daughters. Her family is part of a community, a collection of villages known as a quilombo, whose first members escaped slavery some 250 years ago. Here, enfolded into the hills just beyond the boundaries of Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park, the roads remain unpaved, and electricity hasn’t yet reached the farthest thatch-roofed homes.
Santos is 33 years old; when she was young, she had to walk two hours to get to school each way, though her daughters don’t do that—there’s a new school in her village that becomes a community library at night. Currently, there are 44 separate quilombos in the Cerrado and about 80 different Indigenous ethnicities whose ancestors stretch back to pre-European times. Some hunt, some farm, some fish, some graze livestock. Everyone sings different songs. An accurate census of the Cerrado is elusive, but about 100,000 people are believed to live traditionally off the land. Several groups do not own the legal deeds to their territory, their future destined to be fraught with lawsuits and land battles.
The community Santos comes from has embraced tourism. Sharing the Cerrado, they believe, helps save it. They don’t want bulldozers approaching their hills; they have everything to lose. Any visitors willing to take the long drive from Brasília are welcome.
Santos is one of the guides. Walking the footpaths around her quilombo, she sees through the chaos of shrubs and trees and bushes, indecipherable to most outsiders, and points out ingredients she regularly uses. “These leaves make a lotion for skin care,” she says. “Brew a tea with this for muscle ache. This one’s good for bug bites.”
Tiny black frogs dart abruptly across the path. “They do that when it’s about to rain,” she says, and a few minutes later it does. Santos gained her knowledge of the natural world from her grandmother and mother—“and some from men too, but they’re harder to learn from”—and vows that she will pass on everything to her daughters. “I will not allow our culture to die.”
Prepackaged goods occasionally arrive by truck, but her community, like every quilombo, can grow all its own food. They did it for a couple of centuries, coaxing the soil to yield rice, beans, pumpkins, cassava. Nothing is sprayed with pesticides. You can drink the water right out of the streams. Chickens and cows are raised for meat, rivers provide fish, berries are plentiful.
Buriti palm trees offer roofing material and creamy fruits. Mangaba trees produce plumlike, sugary treats. But the local favorite, Santos says, is definitely the pequi—a fruit native to the Cerrado that’s a little complicated and a touch dangerous to eat, as there are needlelike spines inside that must be carefully avoided. The flavor, a trace of bitter lemon and a hint of cheddar cheese, doesn’t immediately appeal to everyone, but for those who can adapt to the taste, the pequi often becomes a prized delicacy.
The pequi, Santos implies, is like the Cerrado itself. If you’re able to adjust in just the right ways, the prickliness and oddities are not merely tolerated but deeply adored. “I have never wanted to live anywhere else,” she says. One person’s wasteland is another’s wonder.
Witnessing the Cerrado’s wild glory, while also avoiding the afternoon heat, sometimes requires departing with a guide on the national park trails before dawn. Moths flit about your headlamp, crystal fragments glint in the dark. There is a crazy amount of noise. Frogs burp, crickets squeak. A cacophony of insects greets first light. Some sound like power tools, others like kazoos, and whistles, and buzzers—a sense of teeming, infinite life.
Everywhere are twisted tree branches, the Cerrado staple, and vines dangling down like loose wires. From the undergrowth, ferns stretch their herringbone fronds toward the light. Brilliant splashes of color pop from the greenery: purple jasmine, red hibiscus. A candle bush holds up bright yellow blooms, a grand chandelier. A blue morpho butterfly circles, flying stained glass.
The air is a heavy blanket, and a loamy scent lingers. Termite mounds shaped like witches’ hats rise from the soil. A fat lizard lumbers, tongue flitting. Black ants hauling hunks of leaves to their nest look like a procession of tiny windsurfers. A breeze-triggered confetti of white petals tumbles out of a tree. Birds are constant companions—parakeets, hummingbirds, flycatchers, hawks. A toucan bobs beak-heavy through the air as if swimming the breaststroke. A pair of flamboyant macaws, mated for life, rainbow over the treetops.
(This unorthodox method is saving baby macaws from extinction.)
The trail steepens up a bouldery slope, and a sound like rolling thunder starts and doesn’t stop. It only intensifies, soon drowning out even the bugs. Then the forest parts at a rocky outcrop on top of a hill, and there it all is: an expansive sweep of untouched Cerrado, not a farm in sight, the green wilderness sliced open by a deep, cliff-walled canyon, the river within hurtling off a stairway of ledges. The raging waterfalls, the source of the thunder, kick up clouds of mist; the sheer breadth of the view is dizzying and spectacular, the heart of Brazil still beating strong.
But for how long? The director of Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park, a 37-year-old biologist named Nayara Stacheski, says she is fearful. The Cerrado could pass any salvageable tipping point in less than a decade. “This could all become a desert,” she says, and everyone with a stake in the Cerrado will lose.
Many Brazilian scientists who specialize in the Cerrado are in general agreement: It’s hard to halt, or even slow, the march of progress and the force of consumerism. “I’m not optimistic,” says Guarino Colli, an ecology professor at the University of Brasília who studies the Cerrado’s lizards and snakes. Colli indicates that it’s not the celebrated areas like the Amazon rainforest, for which people are willing to donate money and fight to protect, that we should worry about, but rather it is the lesser known, vulnerable lands that could determine our fate. How we treat the Cerrado is, by extension, how we will treat much of the world. What’s at risk, according to the National Campaign in Defense of the Cerrado, “is the life of every being.”
There are no simple solutions. Everyone wants inexpensive commodities; if we don’t farm the Cerrado, we will have to farm elsewhere. Eight billion people need to be fed every day. All nations seek to grow their economy. Nobody is at fault and everybody’s at fault at the same time. “We all have some responsibility for the devastation of the Cerrado,” says Colli. Soybean demand is soaring, and the expansion of farmland will almost surely continue. The lure of cheap cheeseburgers is strong. The Cerrado, it’s possible, will be a place that few will really miss, until it’s closed forever and gone.

TITLE: Our story: How EDF got started

URL: https://edf.org/about/our-history
CONTENT:
The pesticide DDT was used widely in the 1960s. It caused eggshells to thin and break, threatening the survival of magnificent birds like the osprey, bald eagle and peregrine falcon.
DDT is a persistent poison that works its way up the food chain, endangering people, too.
On Long Island, a researcher at a small conservation group was documenting the decline of the osprey. He found that unhatched osprey eggs contained significant concentrations of DDT. The group asked the county to stop using DDT. The mosquito control commission replied that DDT killed mosquitoes cheaply and easily, so they would continue using it.
So the group tried a novel approach, common today but unheard of in the late 1960s: The scientists teamed up with a lawyer and went to court on behalf of the environment.
After many months of preparation, the case was strong. Not only was DDT poisoning birds and crustaceans, but it was also of declining value in mosquito control, as the insects became resistant to it.
In 1966, the court imposed a ban on DDT. Four years later, the governor enacted a statewide ban, based largely on the testimony from that Long Island case. And in 1972, the lawyers and scientists played a major role in securing a nationwide ban.
The osprey has since made a dramatic recovery, and the bald eagle and peregrine falcon have been removed from the endangered species list.
That first court victory presented the local group with a choice. Because this was the first case of its kind, it roused national interest, "out of all proportion to the actual results achieved." Appeals for help came pouring in from across the country, many more than a small group of volunteers could address.
They decided to organize more formally and attempt to raise funds to expand their work. In 1967, they incorporated as Environmental Defense Fund.
Not long after, we began hiring economists, which led to our international prominence in designing market-based solutions. In the 1990s, we pioneered corporate partnerships and some of the first interactive uses of online communications.
In the process, EDF has grown into a leading national nonprofit organization representing more than 3.5 million members and activists – and in 2017, we celebrated 50 years of progress.
We are grateful to have such a strong foundation from which to continue to tackle environmental problems with smart, lasting solutions.
