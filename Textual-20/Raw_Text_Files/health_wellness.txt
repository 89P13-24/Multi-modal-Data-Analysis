TITLE: Why Step Count Remains the Most Impactful Fitness Stat
DATE: 5 min read

CONTENT:
Feb. 28, 2025 â If youâre like many Americans, you probably have a fitness tracker or a smartwatch on your wrist or finger. As of 2023, a little more than a third of the population uses wearable trackers. They flood us with data, hours and quality of sleep, resting heart rate, exercise heart rate, calorie expenditure, time spent standing, step count, step length, step asymmetry, how fast you do stairs, and more.Â
All that data can be overwhelming â sometimes even stressful and counterproductive. Which stats really matter?
âIt can be hard to process all the information streaming in from our watches,â said David Conroy, PhD, professor of applied exercise science at the University of Michigan and a researcher of physical activity tracking. âIn our work, weâve narrowed in on step count as the important metric.â
Unless youâre working toward a specific health or fitness goal, step count indeed stands out among all the others for general wellness and longevity, as more and more research shows. The largest study â a collaborative effort by Johns Hopkins University, the University of Minnesota, and the University of Colorado â combed numbers in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The researchers compared 15 markers that impact longevity, and movement stood above all other measurements. This included predictors like age, gender, race, lifestyle habits, and more. âActivity is an easily modifiable measure, and some of the others are not,â said Erjia Cui, PhD, an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota and one of the studyâs co-authors.Â
The main takeaway: In a world of overwhelming data availability, the simple act of moving more each day will make the biggest difference in your longevity.
With all those handy measurements, why should movement be the one you care most about? âItâs very easy to understand,â said Conroy. âIt represents your volume of activity, whether by running or walking, or some combination of the two.âÂ
If youâre a swimmer or cyclist, or you use a wheelchair, step count isnât going to give you the best measurement, said Conroy. But for most folks, movement on feet is the easiest, most quantitative factor to track. âThe caveat is that these devices have created a trap,â he said. âPeople want an easy answer â am I moving enough?â
That is a more difficult question to answer. For decades, the goal was 10,000 steps a day â but further research has shown that step counts as low as 2,500 still deliver long-term health benefits that increase as your step count rises â even past 10,000. The bottom line, however, is that more movement is better for you and serves as the best measurement of longevity.Â
From where Cui stands, you should make it your goal to achieve as much movement as possible in any given day â and any is better than none. âWe know that the step count measurements on tracking devices are generally accurate, so pay attention to those,â he said.
Lack of a tracker is no problem, said Conroy, as long as youâre moving and you have a general idea of time and distance. âIt could be that keeping a journal about your activity produces just as good a measurement.âÂ
Why? When you manually track your movement, you put thought and reflection into it. This process allows you to think about how you moved, how long, and where, which gives you the opportunity to reflect on whatâs working and whatâs not.Â
For example: if you track a daily walk in your journal, you might notice that it typically falls during your lunch hour. That can give you incentive to prioritize that time for exercise. âA wearable canât do that,â said Conroy. âYouâre actively thinking about your activity, retrieving it from memory, and that forces you to reflect on it.âÂ
Everyone is different, of course, and how you measure your activity isnât as important as doing it. But, Conroy said, devices cost money and arenât accessible to everyone. âWeâve developed a bit of mystique around the trackers,â he said, âand that might be overstated.â
What matters is knowing yourself and what helps motivate you to move. âKnow that the trackers arenât a silver bullet,â he said. âYou can get just as much bang for your buck from tracking activity on your own.âÂ
Ashley Mateo, a 39-year-old freelance writer and running coach, collects and measures a bevy of statistics from both a smartwatch and a ring. âI originally started tracking on an early version Apple watch,â she said. âI wanted to âclose my rings,â hit my calorie goals, and know how much I was moving, If I was doing all the things right, I felt I was healthy.âÂ
The key for Mateo is she has fitness goals more specific than simply looking out for her general health. As a competitive runner, Mateo now crunches certain metrics to enhance her training. In particular, she likes to know her heart rate variability, her resting heart rate, and her sleep patterns. âI donât rely on the data alone, but if Iâm feeling off, I can check my numbers and see if they indicate thereâs a reason for that.â
If the data and how she feels align and indicate she might be getting sick or that she needs more rest and recovery, Mateo might then dial back her run plans for the day. âI follow my body first, and if the watch also tells me I didnât sleep well and should take it easy, then I probably will,â she explained. âThe data has to correlate to how Iâm feeling before I take action.âÂ
She also watches her overall activity and allows her watch to serve as a nudge to move more throughout her day. âIâve noticed that when Iâm moving more than just during my workouts, I feel better,â Mateo said. âIâm in a better mood and have more energy.âÂ
While Mateoâs goals with her devices are different than the general population seeking health and longevity, they demonstrate how the various data can serve people in a variety of ways. âIt really comes down to different strokes for different folks,â said Conroy. âEveryone has their preferences, whether in the type of exercise you choose or how you track movement.âÂ
But if youâre not a competitive athlete and longevity is the goal, you can simplify your life by focusing on the simple data point of movement.Â
âIf we had a drug that could positively impact as many different systems in the body as movement, it would be a blockbuster,â said Conroy. âBut thereâs no pill that can increase longevity, reduce depression and anxiety, improve your bone health, or any other factor as much as exercise.âÂ

TITLE: FDA Approves New Treatment for Stroke
DATE: 2 min read
URL: https://www.webmd.com/stroke/news/20250304/fda-approves-tnkase-treatment-stroke
CONTENT:
March 4, 2025 -- The FDA has approved the first newÂ clot-bustingÂ drug in nearly 30 years, offering a faster way to dissolve blood clots in adults who suffer a stroke.Â
The treatment, tenecteplase (sold as TNKase), delivers a single five-second IV shot, making it a faster, easier option. TNKase was initially approved in 2000 to reduce the risk of death from acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), a severe type of heart attack.
Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States and a major cause of disability, affecting over 795,000 people each year. Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) occurs when a blood clot blocks blood flow to the brain, leading to brain damage, disability, or death. Fast treatment is critical to reduce long-term effects and improve recovery.Â
TNKase is a lab-made version of a natural protein called tPA, which helps break down blood clots. It sticks to fibrin, the protein that holds clots together, and triggers an enzyme to dissolve them. TNKase is designed to target clots better and last longer than natural tPA.
Genentech, part of the Roche group, said in a press release that TNKase can be given quickly,Â unlike Activase (alteplase), which requires an IV injection followed by a 60-minute drip.
The FDA approval was based on a large study conducted by the University of Calgary across 22 stroke centers in Canada and funded by the Canadian Institute of Health Research. Findings showed TNKase was as safe and effective as Activase for treating AIS.
The most common side effects of TNKase include allergic reactions such as hives and bleeding, particularly in patients with active internal bleeding, recent brain or spinal surgery, a serious head injury, or uncontrolled high blood pressure. Patients or caregivers should inform doctors about any episode of bleeding in the brain or stroke within the past three months and about all their prescription and over-the-counter medications, especially blood thinners as they can further increase bleeding risk. They should also immediately contact their doctor if they notice any unusual bleeding (weird bruises, pink or brown pee, bloody or dark stools, coughing up blood, or throwing up blood that looks like coffee grounds) or signs of a stroke.

TITLE: FDA OKs Nasal Spray for Severe Allergic Reactions in Kids
DATE: 2 min read

CONTENT:
March 6, 2025 âÂ The FDA has approved a new nose spray that can quickly treat severe allergic reactions in kids ages 4 and up. This is the first emergency treatment that doesnât use a needle. The spray, called Neffy, delivers medicine in one quick puff into the nose, making it easy to use.
Allergic reactions occur when the immune system responds abnormally to triggers like food, medication, or insect stings, causing symptoms such as hives, swelling, itching, nausea, or trouble breathing. In severe cases, a life-threatening reaction calledÂ anaphylaxis can occur within minutes and requires emergency treatment with epinephrine. This medication helps by raising blood pressure, opening airways, and reducing swelling to restore normal breathing.
First approved in 2024, Neffy 2 milligrams (nasal epinephrine) provided a needle-free option for older children and adults, whileÂ Â younger children under 33 pounds still had to use injection pens, which can be tricky to use and scary for kids. Now,Â the newly approvedÂ Neffy 1 milligram offers a safer, easier alternative, reducing delays and accidental injuries during emergencies.
The approval was based on clinical trials showing Neffy 1 milligram works as well as injectable epinephrine in children and adults, with mostly mild and temporary side effects. Neffyâs maker, ARS Pharma, stated in aÂ press release that studies have shown that kids as young as 10 can use it correctly, and even untrained individuals like teachers and babysitters can administer it effectively.
Common side effects include nasal discomfort or tingling, nosebleeds, sneezing, runny or dry nose or throat, congestion, nausea, vomiting, headache, anxiety, dizziness, and feeling tired or overly excited.
ARS Pharma advises carrying two Neffy sprays as allergic reactions can be unpredictable, and a second dose may be needed if symptoms persist or return â using the same nostril as the first. Parents and caregivers should inform their childâs health care provider about any nasal issues, heart, kidney, or thyroid conditions, as well as any medications their child takes, since some may affect Neffyâs effectiveness. The company expects the medicine to be available by May.Â
