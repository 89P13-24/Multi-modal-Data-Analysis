The CCNA certification is an associate-level certification that covers the fundamentals of IT networking issues. This includes network access, IP connectivity, and IP services. Though itâs not a vendor neutral certificationâmeaning itâll test you exclusively on Cisco products and toolsâitâs popular among network professionals because of Ciscoâs dominance in the networking market. One exam is required to get the CCNA certification.

Cost: $300 to take the exam

Need to build fundamental cybersecurity skills while you earn credentials? Enroll in the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate to familiarize yourself with entry-level skills and tools like Linux, SQL, and Python programming. No previous experience is required.





The Microsoft fundamentals certifications test core technology skills, making them good entry-level qualifications for those who are expected to work with Microsoft products. Knowing your way around Microsoft products is likely to be an in-demand skillâover half of surveyed IT decision-makers worldwide said their companies would invest in Microsoft technology, Global Knowledge reports. The Fundamentals certifications replaced the Microsoft Technology Associate (MTA)Â certifications, which were retired on June 30, 2021.
You can opt to take any one exam in a number of specialized areas that fall under security, Azure (Microsoftâs cloud solution), AI, data, and software like Power Platform, Microsoft 365, and Dynamics. If youâre looking for a certification in an in-demand area, the Microsoft Azure Fundamentals certification will enable you to learn the essentials of Microsoft cloud concepts.

If youâre a student or a career switcher still trying to see if IT is for you, this certification can help you decide. If youâre looking for a certification that will help you gain skills for a job in IT, other certifications like the CompTIA A+ might fit your needs better.

The CompTIA Network+ is a foundational certification in networking principles. Unlike the CCNA, the Network+ is a vendor-neutral certificationâmeaning it doesnât test you on any specific device or technology. The Network+ is considered to be more basic than the CCNA, making it a good option for those who are just starting out in networking, or who find the CCNA too comprehensive for their current needs.Â

Cost: $369 to take the exam

Potential jobs: Network administrator, network engineer, system administrator



Requirements: No formal requirements, but the CompTIA A+ and 9 to 12 months of experience with networks recommended.

TITLE: 8 High-Income Skills to Learn in 2025
DATE: 
URL: https://www.coursera.org/articles/high-income-skills
CONTENT:
Developing these skills could lead to more career versatility and higher-paying salaries.
Every job requires some combination of technical skills and workplace skills.  High-income skills are tools and expertise that employers tend to value because of the important business needs they satisfy. In this article, we'll go over eight high-income skills to learn or strengthen for the coming year.
Afterward, learn job-ready skills from industry leaders like Google, Microsoft, and IBM with a Coursera Plus subscription. Youâll get a certificate for every program you finish, which you can add to further enhance your resume.
Below, youâll find eight high-income skills you can feature on your resume to help stand out to potential employers. To build this list, we referenced reports and platforms forecasting the most in-demand skills through 2030 from Pearson [1], LinkedIn [2], Glassdoor, Coursera [3], and the World Economic Forum [4].
The skills listed here are all transferable across a number of career paths or may be beneficial to strengthening your current career. For instance, a marketing professional may want to enhance their data skills, even if they do not want to work in data more formally, because it can help them discover key insights and build more effective campaigns.
Whether you choose to develop some of the skills below to augment your career or you're interested in pursuing a career built around a certain skill, use the list below to guide you.
Generative AI (GenAI) is a transformative technology that's quickly becoming a requirement across many roles. A growing number of businesses already rely on AI tools to increase their productivity, with even more businesses interested in finding ways to integrate AI into their workstream, business model, products, or services.
Developing GenAI skills, including an ability to prompt engineerâa formal way of describing the ability to refine GenAI requests to get the output you desireâis becoming more crucial. Luckily, there are a variety of ways to build fundamental AI skills or advance what you already know. If you're interested in an AI career, here are some roles that use AI heavily, along with average base pay in the United States as of February 2025, according to Glassdoor:






As businesses across industries increasingly rely on data to make informed decisions, they require employees with the ability to collect, interpret, and share data that can solve their business problems.
People skilled in data analysis may use a range of tools, including Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, SQL, Tableau, R, or Python. Here are some careers that use data analysis, along with average base pay in the United States as of February 2025, according to Glassdoor:






Industries now regularly turn toward technology to advance their business capabilities, and they need people skilled in developing, maintaining, and improving their technological systems. People who work in DevOps or software engineering build, monitor, and control an organizationâs technology.
People skilled in DevOps or software engineering may use tools like Git, Docker, Jenkins, or Kubernetes, and may know coding languages like Python, Java, or C++. Here are some careers that use software development, along with average base pay in the United States as of February 2025, according to Glassdoor:





Hand in hand with technological development comes user experience (UX), which has to do with the way a consumer interacts with a product. People working in UX figure out the best way to present a product to consumers. They may conduct research, design, or help market a product.
Although they still involve some data, UX roles are grounded in design and tend to offer room for creativity, and they require a high level of social perceptivenessâthree skills that come up in multiple skill reports [4, 1]. Here are some careers utilizing user experience skills, along with average base pay in the United States as of February 2025, according to Glassdoor:






Web development brings together the fundamentals of software development and user experience, incorporating the technical aspects of the former with the design elements of the latter. People skilled in web development will also be familiar with technical search engine optimization (SEO) in order to design and program websites that meet business needs.
Here are some careers that require web development skills, along with average base pay in the United States as of February 2025, according to Glassdoor:





Many companies use an organizational structure in which different departments, teams, or team members all work on a singular product or project. A person who is skilled in coordinating efforts across each of those touchpoints is skilled in project management. These team members may be responsible for maintaining schedules, organizing budgets, and communicating with project stakeholders (or various parties interested or invested in the project outcomes).
You can consider âproject management skillsâ to be a catch-all term for leadership, communication, planning, resilience, and organizational skillsâall of which are frequently cited as valuable to employers. Project management shows up in many careers and becomes especially important as you move into managerial positions. However, you can also pursue a career as a project manager. Here are some careers along the project manager path and their average base pay in the United States as of February 2025, according to Glassdoor:






While project management typically has an internal focus, account management taps into a similar subset of skills to work with people outside of your organization. Often highly valued in sales positions, account management skills enable you to confidently position your company and its products to customers.
Account management skills incorporate both the organizational aspects required to close a business deal as well as the interpersonal skills required to productively negotiate and maintain relationships. They often work with a customer relationship management (CRM) tool like Salesforce.
Here are some careers that use account management and sales skills, along with average base pay in the United States as of February 2025, according to Glassdoor:





Content creation and management skills involve storytelling and are often crucial for marketing careers. This skill set incorporates creativity, originality, social perceptiveness, and emotional intelligence. Taking these skills a step further can also mean adding data analysis to your toolbox, specifically honing in on marketing analytics so that you can assess how well an audience is connecting with your content.
Here are some careers that use content creation and management skills, along with average base pay in the United States as of February 2025, according to Glassdoor:





Continue building high-income skills through courses, specializations, and Professional Certificates on Coursera. Develop new knowledge, learn about important tools, and get hands-on practice through assignments to keep expanding your skill set.
With a Coursera Plus subscription, available in monthly and annual tiers, you'll gain access to more learning programs from world-class universities and companies.

CONTENT:
With over a million certification holders worldwide, the PMP is widely recognized and has been linked to multiple benefits for project managers. Here's what you need to know to get started.
The Project Management Professional (PMP)Â® certification is a globally recognized project management certification that tests a candidateâs ability to manage people, processes, and business priorities. According to the Project Management Institute (PMI), which administers the certification, there are over one million PMP-certified professionals worldwide. It applies to project managers in virtually any industry, including health, construction, information technology (IT), and business.
To earn this certification, youâll first need to acquire 35 hours of project management education. You can meet this experience requirement while simultaneously earning a certificate from another industry leader by enrolling in the self-paced, online Google Project Management Professional Certificate program.
Read more about PMP certification requirements, cost, and exam questions in the article below:
You must validate your project management experience and education to take the certification exam. There are three sets of training requirements to choose from:

As of October 2024, the exam fee is $675 for non-PMI members and $425 for PMI members [1]. A PMI membership costs $159 a year, with special membership options for eligible students and retirees.
The PMP certification is valid for three years but can be renewed or maintained by earning spend 60 hours (also referred to as professional development units) during that time frame on professional development activities to maintain it. Otherwise, you'll need to sign up to take the exam again.
Hereâs a step-by-step guide to getting your PMP certification:
Before you can take the PMP exam, youâll have to make sure youâre eligible using the criteria specified above.
Youâll want to keep track of your projects and training, recording information like your specific role, responsibilities, and length of projects or training so that you have it at hand when you apply. This training requirement can be waived if you already have a CAPM certification or met by completing the Google Project Management Professional Certificate program, which provides you with an additional credential for your resume while you prepare for the PMP:





Make an account using the PMI website to get started on your application for the PMP exam. This will entail sharing basic personal information like your educational background, as well as details about the projects youâve worked on.Â
Once youâre approved, youâll pay the exam fee and schedule a test.
Studying for the exam will take some planning and determination. You can train for this exam either through structured coursework or on your own. Generally, exam prep providers recommend spending 60 to 120 hours studying. A survey by PM Exam Lessons Learned found that successful exam takers dedicated two to six months for practice. Depending on how frequently you study, this can take several months. Consider taking practice exams and studying PMI resources to prepare.
The PMP certification is not an entry-level exam. It can be challenging, even for experienced project managers. It requires a strong knowledge of the Project Management Body of Knowledge and the ability to think critically to apply these guidelines and other industry-standard practices to a variety of workplace situations.

The exam can be taken at a testing site near you or online. The exam typically takes around four hours to complete.
The PMP certification is valid for three years. Youâll need to spend 60 hours during that time frame on professional development activities to maintain it. Otherwise, you can sign up to take the exam again.
Ultimately, whether a PMP certification will be worth it to you professionally and financially depends on your unique circumstances. Here are a few benefits you might see with a PMP under your belt to help you navigate your decision.
Industry recognition: The PMP certification can show employers or clients that you know the ins and outs of project management, and have the experience and training required of a professional.
Learning new skills: You are also likely to learn a significant amount about project management as you prepare for the exam. Taking hours out of your life to master project management fundamentals like conflict resolution and budgeting can bolster the skills to make you a better project manager.
Higher salaries: The PMI found that respondents to a recent survey who are PMP certification holders reported a 33 percent higher median salary than those without the certification [2]. PC Magazine reported that the PMP certification ranked third among IT certifications that were linked to the highest salaries in the IT sector [3].
Job prospects: According to a report compiled by PMI and the Anderson Economic Group, employers will need 87.7 million individuals working in project management roles by 2027. The biggest growth is expected in the health care sector, though large gains are also projected in the construction, information services, and finance and insurance sectors [4].
The PMP certification is designed to build on and solidify the training an experienced project manager already has. If youâre just starting out as a project manager, you may want to gain more experience or look into another certificationâlike the CAPMâbefore getting a PMP. The Google Project Management: Professional Certificate is also designed for those just starting out, and will earn you an employer-recognized professional credential.
Hereâs an overview of whatâs on the PMP certification test as of October 2024.

The amount of time it takes to learn artificial intelligence depends on several factors, including:

Prerequisite knowledge: If you have general knowledge of math and statistics, you can skip straight toward learning AI skills and tools.

Career intent: If you want to pursue a job in the AI field, youâll want a more comprehensive education than someone who simply wants to add context to their data analytics role.

Background knowledge: If youâre switching from another major or field, then itâll take longer to learn than someone who is already working in the technology field and has a basic understanding of its complex jargon.Â

Artificial intelligence is computer software that mimics how humans think in order to perform tasks such as reasoning, learning, and analyzing information. Machine learning is a subset of AI that uses algorithms trained on data to produce models that can perform those tasks. AI is often performed using machine learning, but it actually refers to the general concept, while machine learning refers to only one method within AI.Â
