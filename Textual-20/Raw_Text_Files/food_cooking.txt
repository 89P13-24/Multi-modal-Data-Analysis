TITLE: What’s the Difference Between Coconut Milk and Coconut Cream?

Have you ever wanted to make a recipe calling for coconut cream, but you only have coconut milk on hand? Wondering if you can swap one for the other? Sorry to break the bad news, but the two products aren’t the same. While coconut milk and coconut cream are both blends of coconut meat and water, coconut cream uses far less than coconut milk, making it much richer. As a result, each product has distinct applications in cooking. Confusing things further, cream of coconut exists in a camp all her own. Let us explain.
The primary difference between coconut milk and coconut cream is fat content. “Think of it like butter versus heavy cream,” explains senior test kitchen editor Shilpa Uskokovic. “Coconut milk has a higher water content, and coconut cream, much like butter, has a higher concentration of fat.”
For the record, when we say coconut milk, we’re referring to regular, full-fat coconut milk. Fat-free and reduced-fat versions are bolstered with gums that help mimic the texture of the real stuff. While they may work in some recipes, those stabilizers can wreak havoc on baked goods and sauces.
To make coconut milk or coconut cream, manufacturers blend fresh coconut meat with either fresh water or coconut water (the liquid sloshing around in the coconut’s center). Look for a brand with an ingredients list that’s as minimal as possible. Shilpa recommends Aroy-D for coconut milk and Thai Kitchen for both coconut milk and coconut cream.
Or, if you want to DIY, you can make either product at home in the same way. Just crack open a fresh coconut (or open a bag of desiccated grated coconut or coconut flakes) and blitz it with your desired amount of liquid before straining out the solids.
Coconut milk’s looser texture makes it well-suited to broth, as in our recipes for Curry Vegetables and Coconut-Lentil Soup. It also works well in marinades, bringing its signature creamy, tropical flavor along for the ride. Shilpa says she uses coconut milk (as compared to cream) more often in savory cooking, favoring it for Indian and Thai cuisine; try it in her Creamy Coconut Curry Meatballs.
Coconut milk is also a wonderful dairy alternative for vegan baking. While canned coconut milk tends to be richer than regular milk—as well as other nondairy milks—you’ll often find “coconut milk beverage” in the refrigerated section of some grocery stores. This secondary product is thinned even further than canned varieties and is intended to be used as a 1:1 milk substitute in cereal, as a coffee creamer, in smoothies, and the like.
“When I’m looking for a more concentrated flavor and texture,” Shilpa says, “I use coconut cream.” This product’s higher fat content makes it a workhorse for adding body and richness to soups, curries, and sauces. Because of its dense texture, coconut cream is also a wonderful dairy-free alternative to heavy cream for desserts. Use it in a vegan chocolate mousse or to make a coconut whipped cream topping. It also works well in frostings.
Yes! When you make coconut cream from scratch, the fat solids separate from the liquid as the mixture sits, especially when chilled. This also happens in canned coconut milk—there’s just a smaller ratio of fat to water. Shaking a can of coconut milk before you open it can emulsify the liquids and fat. But if you need coconut cream in a pinch, don’t shake that can. Instead, gently open the can and scrape the top layer of fat from the surface to use as cream. While this is an option, it’s not a full-time substitute for the real thing. Shilpa says, “If I were making vegan whipped cream, I’d go to the supermarket and find canned coconut cream,” which you can be sure has a suitable concentration of fat for becoming aerated.
Despite having similar ingredients and production methods, they are not interchangeable. Consider how the water content of the milk and cream might affect your dish before swapping one for the other. “I’d substitute coconut cream for coconut milk because I can always thin out the cream with a bit of water,” Shilpa says. Meanwhile, if you choose to use coconut milk in a recipe that calls for coconut cream, you’ll need to let it cook for a longer time on the stovetop so that the excess liquid can evaporate. And that’s not such a quick affair since you don’t want to boil coconut milk—it might curdle and separate.
An essential ingredient for tropical drinks, cream of coconut is not the same thing as canned coconut cream. It’s coconut cream sweetened with sugar, and it often includes added stabilizers—think of it like sweetened condensed coconut milk. Coco López is one popular brand. You’ll see it in a number of cocktail recipes, most notably the Piña Colada. Because of its high sugar content, it can also be a great addition to your dessert pantry. Shilpa likes to caramelize it in the style of dulce de leche or bake it into a coconut pound cake.

TITLE: You Don’t Need a Granola Recipe, Just This Golden Ratio
DATE: Kitchen Intelligence
URL: https://epicurious.com/expert-advice/how-to-make-granola-without-a-recipe-article
CONTENT:
Where there are languishing nuts, seeds, and rolled oats, there is homemade granola begging to be made. And this granola recipe (if you can even call it a recipe) is less a directive than an invitation to customize to your heart’s content.
Making granola at home has a few things going for it. It’s cheaper than store-bought granola, for one. It can be healthier if you choose for it to be—and it can certainly be engineered toward your particular dietary preferences. And, because it’s a blank canvas for your exact granola proclivities, it’s objectively tastier.
The demands of making your own granola are few. You don’t even need to adhere to a persnickety granola recipe. Instead, we offer our Golden Granola Ratio. It’s a mere skeleton of a recipe, with general measurements, cook times, seasoning principles, and the like—but the rest is entirely up to you. Keep it in your back pocket and let your imagination do the rest of the work. Throw chia seeds and dried cranberries in the first batch, then chocolate chips and shredded coconut in the next. Follow the rules and your homemade granola recipe will be just that: Yours. And it will always yield a crispy, toasty batch ready to hang out with yogurt, milk, or just be happy to be along for the ride.
Coconut flakes, pistachios, walnuts, dried cherries, and golden raisins make for a stunning—and delicious—granola.
Remember: The best granola is the one you make for yourself. Keep this basic formula at hand and forever reap the rewards.
You have just one thing to remember: 6 parts dry to 1 part wet. Your “parts” can be any measurement based on how many servings you want: 1 cup, 1 bin scoop, one juice glass, one cereal bowl, one palmful (though this last option can get messy). Set this ratio to memory (or write it down), then head to the kitchen and preheat your oven to 300°.
There’s only one nonnegotiable in granola, and that’s rolled oats. The rest is up to you. Don’t use quick-cooking oats, which don’t offer the same texture as regular old-fashioned rolled oats.
Other dry ingredients you might want to include are your favorite nuts and seeds and/or other rolled, flaked, or puffed grains. Think chopped pecans, pumpkin seeds, cashews, pistachios, sesame seeds, puffed millet, coconut flakes, chia seeds, and flaxseed. Or cereals like bran or cornflakes, Cheerios or puffed rice. For a nice balance of flavor and texture, aim for a mix of at least 4 dry ingredients; a good ratio to follow is 3 parts oats, 1 part nuts, 1 part seeds, and 1 part something else. Toss everything in a large bowl until well mixed.
To turn those grains, nuts, and seeds into a magical heap of crunchy, golden clumps, you must coat them in fat and sugar. If you start with six cups of dry stuff, you’ll need one cup of wet stuff. I usually use one large egg white for this amount of granola, then use equal portions of liquid sweetener and liquid fat to reach the amount of wet ingredients required. The egg white isn’t essential, but it helps create larger clumps and makes the granola extra crunchy with a glossier finish. You can also use a whole egg for more protein.
Choose a fat whose flavor you can get excited about, like warmed coconut oil, ghee, extra virgin olive oil, or a combination. For a neutral flavor, try grapeseed, canola, or sunflower seed oil. You could also mix a fat-rich ingredient like tahini or peanut butter with oil until it’s a runny consistency.
For the sweetener, it’s easiest to use one in a liquid state (like honey; coconut nectar; or agave, brown rice, or maple syrup). But, if you want to try infusing your granola with other flavors, like fresh ginger or citrus peels, make simple syrup by blending sugar and water, adding the aromatics to it before straining them out. Whisk your wet ingredients to combine in a small bowl, then pour the mixture over your dry mix and toss well until everything is thoroughly coated.
Once you’ve got everything mixed, taste it. How’s it doing? You want a little spice in there, right? Ground cinnamon is always nice, as is vanilla extract, cardamom, nutmeg, and salt. Add in as little or as much spice as you want, but always add salt (about 1 tsp. for our six-cup hypothetical)—it perks up all the flavors. Taste again; if you want more sweetness, sprinkle in a bit of white or brown sugar.
Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper, then spread your granola mixture in an even layer. If that layer is too thick, get another rimmed sheet pan and divide the mixture between the two. Bake until the granola is toasty, golden brown, about 45 minutes.
If you want dried fruit or chopped chocolate in your granola, wait until after it’s baked. Stir fruit such as dried cranberries, cherries, raisins, or sliced dried apricots into the hot granola right after you pull it out of the oven. For things like chocolate or toffee, wait until the granola is cool to the touch before tossing in your mix-ins. I recommend using about 1 part mix-ins of this nature, but this is your granola: If you want half chewy dried fruit, half crispy oat clusters, go for it!
Let your homemade granola cool to room temperature completely before digging in or transferring it to a jar or airtight container. It will keep in your pantry for about two weeks and even longer if you keep it in the freezer.
This granola has sesame seed, pepitas, and pecans. Serve it with milk for breakfast and forget about the cereal aisle completely.

The best food processorThe best budget food processorHow we testedWhat we looked for in a food processorWhen to use a food processor, when to use a blenderOther food processors we tested
Food processors promise a life of simplicity in the kitchen. And the best food processor delivers on that promise. It slices! It dices! It shreds! It makes pie dough and hummus! But depending on which model you choose, what size food processor you want, and the price tag you’re willing to pay, the large base can weigh as much as a small child, and come with such a dizzying array of attachments that ingredient prep feels less like cooking and more like an IQ test. Finding the best food processor for you means considering both its performance and its features—all the ones you want and none that you don’t.
We first reviewed food processors in 2018, putting a small fleet of the beloved appliance to the test to measure efficiency, versatility, and ease with cleaning and storage. Every year since then, we’ve added to the review, pitting past winners against new models to ensure we always have the highest-performing machines listed as our top picks.

Breville Sous Chef 12-Cup Food Processor
Amazon
Williams Sonoma
Breville
Pros: Powerful, easy to operate, stable
Cons: Heavy
With a sturdy build, simple controls, a useful array of attachments, the Breville Sous Chef 12-cup food processor is a high-quality appliance that lives up to its name: It’s the right-hand man you’ve always wanted in the kitchen. This food processor has a 1,000-watt motor and 12-cup dry capacity (8½ cups for liquid). That’s big enough for most tasks and we wouldn’t recommend going any smaller unless you have a really small kitchen and storage space is significant issue (even if it is, a good food processor is maybe the one appliance you should make extra room for). It readily handled every test we threw at it, and the included grater, slicing blade served us well.
Though Breville is not as big a name in food processors as, say, Cuisinart, it is a leader in intelligent design (see, well, a lot of our other product reviews)—and indeed, beyond the Sous Chef 12’s mere power, its assortment of thoughtful, user-driven design tweaks made it stand out from the pack. Sitting snug on the base like a blender, the work bowl is very easy to attach and detach, never leaks, and doesn’t require the latching, turning, and locking that’s common with other brands. Also, from a purely tactile standpoint, all the Sous Chef 12 components feel great in the hand, especially the smooth ergonomic handle on the work bowl and the lid. We also liked how the work bowl is clearly marked with measurements in both cups and milliliters, and how the neat pour spout makes it feel like a nice big measuring cup when maneuvering it from the base to the counter.
The Sous Chef sports a wider “feed chute”—the opening in the top of the lid that you push ingredients through—than many of the other food processors we tried, which makes shredding and slicing easier because you don’t have to precut food into smaller pieces. It’s also one of the quietest machine we tested, and its slicing disc is adjustable from 0.3 mm to 8 mm, upping its versatility.
The base is quite heavy (about 16 lb.), and the processor bowl, lid, pusher, and attachments can deteriorate if regularly cleaned in the dishwasher (this may also potentially negate Breville’s one-year limited warranty). Thankfully, it’s not too difficult to hand-wash due to its streamlined design. It also doesn’t come with a storage case, as they are sold separately, and having multiple discs floating around in a drawer is not ideal.

Hamilton Beach Big Mouth Duo Plus 12-Cup Food Processor
Amazon
Walmart
Home Depot
Pros: Affordable, wide feed chute
Cons: Suction cup feet aren’t as stable as a heavy base
While not as sturdy, strong, or flashy as our top best food processor pick, the 12-cup Hamilton Beach Big Mouth Duo does an exceptional job at a bargain basement price. And, as promised, it does have a big mouth—we were easily able to fit whole medium-size onions and barely broken down vegetables through the chute and into the bowl without issue. It took only a few short pulses to turn whole onions into small, even pieces; not once did we need to stop to pry an onion off of a stubbornly lodged blade or scrape the sides down to ensure every bit was getting equal attention.
Cheese shredded cleanly and evenly in seconds without any leftover nubs or odd bits. The hummus came out just about as smooth as can be without stopping and scraping the bowl during its 5-minute processing time. Pie dough came together in a flash, with perfectly sized pebbles of ice-cold butter evenly dispersed throughout.
The Big Mouth doesn’t always need to tackle big jobs, and it comes with a smaller 4-cup bowl for quick chopping and mincing. For storage, the small bowl and all the attachments fit into the machine, and there’s a cord storage area on the underside of the unit. As for cleanup, this is one of the only models we tried that’s dishwasher-safe, which we love not only for convenience, but also because it let us clean the ultrasharp blade and shredding discs without damaging our sponge or nicking our fingers.
Compared to the Breville Sous Chef, the 500-watt Hamilton Beach’s motor is only half as powerful — but it’s also half the weight and less than one quarter of the price. Unlike the Breville’s variable slicing disc, which has 24 settings for various thicknesses, the Hamilton Beach’s is static, offering one size and one size only. The Big Mouth also doesn’t come with a dedicated dough blade, though we found the sharp S-blade to be more than serviceable when making pie dough.
Capacity: 12-cup capacitySize: 7.5" x 10" x 14.7"Power: 500 wattsIncluded attachments: Stainless-steel S-blade, reversible slicer/shredder, 4-cup mini food processor bowlAttachments sold separately: NoneWarranty: 1-year
We focused our testing on three of the most commonly used food processor functions: chopping, shredding, and processing. For the first, we used the chopping blade on two onions with the pulse function and examined the results for consistency and quality; points were deducted for uneven pieces or watery, pulverized results. For the second, we used the shredding disc to dispatch a large block of sharp cheddar cheese, taking note of the texture and consistency of the shreds and how much (if any) waste was left over. We also considered how hard it was to wash and clean the shredding blade. To test the processing power, we prepared a batch of hummus and our favorite pie dough in each machine, swapping out the metal blade for the dough blade if included. We kept an eye on the performance of the motor, the ease of use and cleaning, and the quality of the finished product.
Besides examining the results of the individual prep tests explained above, we considered the following for all food processors we tested:
The whole point of a large food processor is to make daunting prep tasks more manageable, so we were looking for models that could easily accommodate generous batches of dough, small mountains of shredded cheese, and an oversized Dutch oven’s worth of stew ingredients. We also paid attention to the strength and smoothness of the motor: Did it strain when working at high speeds or processing thick and sticky mixtures? When chopping, were its pulses firm and even?
Most food processors have similar standard parts: a motorized base to which a food processor bowl attaches and a small selection of blades and shredders that rotate from a spindle inside of the bowl. We made note of extras like dedicated dough blades, bowls that doubled as measuring cups, and adjustable slicing discs that went the extra mile. While a dishwasher-safe model is nice, we didn’t let that factor in too strongly, because we suggest hand-washing food processors to preserve the longevity of the gaskets.
The desire to avoid redundancy in your kitchen tools is a common one, which is why many people make the mistake of thinking that food processors and blenders are relatively interchangeable. As nice as that would be, the two appliances are suited for very different kitchen tasks, and, frankly, are subpar at doing the job of the other. Food processors are great at chopping and mincing veggies, grating blocks of cheese at high speed, kneading pizza and bread doughs, and making thick sauces and dips like pesto and hummus. However, because a food processor’s bowl is so wide, it can’t thoroughly blend ingredients for a super smooth purée. Blenders really only function well for tasks with high amounts of liquid due to their long and narrow shape. They are perfect for puréeing soups and smoothies. but a consistent rough chop is nearly impossible, even in a high-end blender like a Vitamix. That being said, heavy-duty blenders with powerful motors are great for making nut butters. Liquids or ultrafine consistencies? Go for the blender. Anything chunky, choppy, or thick? Food processors are the better choice. And, given their totally different design, this should go without saying, but neither make a particularly good juicer. You can find our list of the best blenders here.

Cuisinart Core Custom 13-Cup Multifunctional Food Processor
Amazon
For many people, Cuisinart is to food processors what KitchenAid is to stand mixers—or what Kleenex is to tissues. And this take on a Cuisinart food processor is an impressive appliance that passed all our trials with near flying colors. It shredded cheese with ease, leaving us with fluffy, even shreds without any leftover knobs or odd crumbles. Five minutes of uninterrupted processing produced hummus that was light, airy, and deliciously smooth. Pie dough pulled together quickly, with small, even pieces of butter, and a finished product that was easy to gather together and roll out after resting. It also comes with multiple speeds: high, low, and mix, designed for tasks like emulsifying. The only quibble occurred during our pulse chop test, when the blade stubbornly lodged itself into large pieces of onion. They eventually dislodged themselves without the need for us to manually pry them off, but by the time they did, our onions were minced—not chopped. But again, this is a minor quibble that doesn’t distract from the fact that the Cuisinart Core Custom is a damn fine food processor. It also converts, with the help of separately sold food processor attachments, into a juicer, a blender, and a mini food processor.

Cuisinart Pro Custom 11-Cup Food Processor
Amazon
Performance-wise, the Cuisinart Pro Custom 11-Cup Food processor is pretty indistinguishable from the Core Custom above. The big difference is that it comes equipped with a chopping and kneading cover, which has a low, flat profile and a central opening that makes it easier to add ingredients when making pie doughs and pastry. If you plan on using your food processor for a lot of baking projects, you might appreciate this design feature.

Breville Paradice 9 Food Processor
Amazon
The Paradice 9 is the smaller iteration of Breville’s updated line of food processors. The compact model features a redesigned attachment caddy that locks into place on top of the mixing bowl. The Paradice 9 is also compatible with the Breville+ app, which includes step-by-step instructions for recipes that guide you through using the appliance. The app is particularly good Breville’s Joule products, which it can actually control. For the Paradice 9, though, it just provides little how-to videos directing you on what to do during a recipe. Lastly, it comes with a dicing attachment kit that is supposed to cut things into precise, cubic chunks. As for our standard test, the Paradice 9 was pretty indistinguishable from the Sous. We found the dicing attachment to be really fussy and cumbersome. While this is still a great appliance, we aren’t entirely convinced that the new attachments are a significant improvement on the design.

Cuisinart 14-Cup Food Processor
Amazon
This is the newer version of Cuisinart’s iconic food processor, once called the Classic Series. We found this to be a totally workable processor at a more affordable price point for people who want a straightforward machine with no extras. However, the Breville was simpler to set up, ran quieter, and came with a wider range of attachments, so ultimately this model didn’t take a top spot.

Cuisinart Elemental Small Food Processor, 13-Cup, Gunmetal
Amazon
Walmart
This Cuisinart comes at a reduced price compared to the 14-cup model above. It’s noticeably flimsier than its more expensive siblings, which is called out in a significant number of online user reviews. Additionally, the machine’s pulsing function is less precise than other models because the blade doesn’t stop spinning abruptly; after the motor stops, it continues briefly until it loses momentum on its own.

Breville Sous Chef Pro 16-Cup Food Processor
Amazon
This is our top pick’s big sister; it comes with a number of additional attachments and four extra cups of bowl capacity, making it the largest processor we tested by two whole cups. It was also the heaviest (at 26 lb.) and tied for the most expensive. We just found it too hefty an appliance for a normal home kitchen. If you engage in some quasi-industrial baking projects, it performs well, though.

Cuisinart 9-Cup Continuous Feed Food Processor
Amazon
The Cuisinart Continuous Feed didn’t fare as well in our tests as its competitors, but to be fair, it’s not really designed to be a powerhouse all-around processor. With a bowl that can only handle 9 cups, it’s too small to fit vegetables that haven’t been pre-chopped or produce hummus that’s smooth and creamy. This machine is designed for one thing: slicing and shredding large quantities of food without needing to continually transfer the results to a larger bowl. In addition to its standard processing bowl, this food processor comes with a special continuous feed bowl, which has a chute that immediately ejects sliced/shredded food into the container of your choice. Position a pot or mixing bowl beneath the chute, and you can process plenty of potatoes, carrots, cheese, or whatever else you please without pause. It makes quick work of vegetables, which could make it a good buy for people who meal prep or subsist on large amounts of salad. But if you need a food processor that can do more than shred and slice, you should look elsewhere.

Ninja Professional Plus 9-Cup Food Processor
Target
This was the least expensive model we tested and also the smallest—though the 9-cup work bowl was more than enough for a batch of hummus or single pie crust. Each of the two included blade attachments (one for chopping, one for dough) had a unique double-decker design that helped integrate all the ingredients without stopping and scraping them down with a spatula. But the reversible slicing blades weren’t as effective as some of the other models we tested, leaving large unsliced chunks of onion and hunks of cheese.

Magimix by Robot-Coupe 14-Cup Food Processor
Williams Sonoma
This pricey processor didn’t live up to its promise. The volume and violence of the motor while processing onions was off-putting, it leaked flour into the base when prepping pie dough, and left large chunks of cheese untouched when shredding cheddar. And the whole thing—a giant base and huge battery of attachments—took up so much counter space it seemed impractical for all but the most zealous home cooks with enormous kitchens.

GE 12-Cup Food Processor
Amazon
As good-looking as this machine is, it has multiple design flaws that make it a bad buy. We needed to cut onions into smaller pieces to fit into the large bowl; the small chopping bowl insert was all but useless, requiring us to essentially chop the onions ourselves before the machine could take a crack at them. The included discs are significantly smaller than the bowl, leaving a ½" gap on all sides for large chunks of cheese to slip through when shredding or slicing. Our hummus recipe required five uninterrupted minutes of processing; while the motor was able to handle it, the finished product was grainy. It did a fine job of pulling together pie dough, but that doesn’t make up for failing three of our four trials.

13-Cup Food Processor with Dicing Kit
KitchenAid
This one fell to the bottom of our list in terms of both aesthetics and user experience. We found the base and accessory box needlessly bulky, and the performance, though satisfactory for basic chopping tasks, inconsistent for shredding and pastry.
Sadly, discontinued, this was our choice if you wanted to level up from the Breville Sous Chef. In our test, the Elite model really blew most of the competition out of the water in terms of versatility and effectiveness, and it cost about $50 more than the Breville Sous Chef 12. If you’re looking for a larger bowl capacity than the Sous Chef 12 and don’t want to spring for the bigger Sous Chef 16, we’d point you to the Cuisinart Custom 14 mentioned above, which comes in at the same price as the Sous Chef 12. Cuisinart’s Custom 14 has a large capacity bowl and an extra-large feed tube along with brand’s trademark durability (reflected in a 3-year warranty) and a lot of extras, which we consider worth the splurge—especially for a machine that’s sure to last you a very long time.
We’re home cooks just like you—and we bring a home cook’s perspective to all of our rigorous testing. But unlike you, we have an extra 10 hours a day to spend geeking out over kitchen tools because it is literally our job. We don’t only use our recommended products in controlled settings, we bring the best ones into our own kitchens to help us put dinner on the table on a Wednesday night for our families, or to throw a dinner party for 12. When we recommend a product, you should trust that we’ve used it—a lot—just like you will. Read more about our testing process and philosophy here.

The best drip coffee maker overallThe best big drip coffee makerThe best budget drip coffee makerWhat we looked for How we testedOther drip coffee makers we testedHow to pick coffee beans for your drip coffee maker
To some people, the idea of making coffee with a drip coffee maker, even the best drip coffee maker, is laughable. That’s because there are plenty of coffee drinkers out there, including more than one Epicurious editor, who think a cup of coffee is not simply a beverage like a can of soda or a glass of water but an artwork that needs to be carefully formed and obsessed over. But this view of drip coffee makers is outdated. Lumping everything in the category in with the $17 coffee machines available at the Walgreens checkout that can turn to dust in your hands does a disservice to how far the technology of drip coffee has come.
Actually, the best drip coffee makers have tech that rivals lots of espresso machines in terms of temperature and brewing control—they’re much closer to a fastidiously made carafe of pour-over coffee than they are to the brute force method that comes with, say, an average K-cup single-serve coffee maker. And they are oh so convenient. Even a basic budget model offers the ability to set it the night before and wake up to pleasant coffee aromas wafting into your bedroom and a full pot waiting for you as soon as you come downstairs. You can and should expect great coffee from a drip a coffee maker.
If that kind of carefree, no-hassle coffee lifestyle sounds appealing, read on for our top picks for drip coffee makers. For more about how we tested, which coffee makers you shouldn’t consider, and tips on how to make the best cup of coffee, scroll down toward the bottom.

Fellow Aiden
Fellow
Williams Sonoma
Pros: The most customizable machine out there, easy for beginners to use, best tasting coffee in our tests
Cons: Expensive
When we first tried the Fellow Aiden in our test kitchen, we were impressed. It offered the ability to tweak every single brewing parameter to adjust the flavor of your pot of coffee just like you would a carafe of pour-over coffee. We could turn the dial and adjust the water temperature anywhere from 122℉ (for cold brew, more on that later) to 210℉. We could change the bloom time, which helps release carbon dioxide and eliminate off flavors. We could shorten or extend the bursts of water that shower down on the coffee grounds. But it wasn’t until we took it home and spent a few weeks with it that we really got a sense of what it could do. We tasted coffee from the Aiden side by side with Chemexes full of pour-over coffee, and the automated brew from the Aiden offered the same sorts of fruity and caramel notes we got from our pour-over. The scheduling feature one-ups those on most other machines because you can set it to when you’d like the brew to begin and when you’d like it to end.
Fellow founder Jake Miller told us that he wanted it to be a good machine for coffee obsessives, but also a good one for coffee novices. To that end, once you select one of the brew profiles (light roast, medium roast, or dark roast) and the amount of coffee you want to brew, the Aiden’s LCD screen displays the amount of ground coffee you should add in both grams and tablespoons. You can also use the Instant Brew setting that brews however much water is in the water tank with a single button push (basically what you’d get from a $50 drip coffee maker, except the Aiden brews to the Specialty Coffee Association’s Golden Cup standard—a combination of water temperature and coffee-to-water ratio)
The interface is intuitive and simple—just a single dial and a button to the scroll and click through the menu options. And the thermal carafe is one of the best we’ve tried, keeping coffee above 110℉ for around two hours. The removable side water tank is as easy to fill with a measuring cup at the machine as it as in the sink or at the fridge.
Finally, there's that cold-brew setting. Lots of machines have a “cold brew” or “iced” coffee setting. Most of them make claims that they can complete a cup in just a few minutes. That’s not really possible as the extraction process of cold brew is entirely different from brewing hot coffee and needs to take much longer. The Aiden actually performs one of these slow brews, dripping out much cooler water over the course of hours. The result is the best cold brew from an automatic coffee machine we’ve tried.
This is the most expensive drip coffee maker we’ve ever tested. Though, we’d note it isn’t that much more expensive than the much simpler Technivorm we also recommend below. But we know that price tag will be a turn off for some people. Other than that, switching from the single-serve brew basket to the full pot brew basket is a little annoying (you have to turn a plastic dial inside the lid). But that’s a pretty small quibble considering everything else this machine does.

Oxo Brew 12-Cup Coffee Maker With Podless Single-Serve Function
Amazon
Oxo
Pros: Big enough for all occasions, can brew single serve, effective thermal carafe
Cons: Fixed water reservoir
The Oxo is not quite as feature-laden as the Fellow Aiden, but it does give you more coffee. The Aiden is a 10-cup machine, which may be plenty for you, but in the case of hosting a large brunch or dinner party you may want to max out what you can get in a single carafe. The extra two cups of volume don't come at the expense of coffee quality though. The Oxo produced the kinds of nuanced flavors that really are table stakes at this point for high quality drip coffee makers. It also has some of the smart design features Oxo is famous for. Most importantly is the machine's ability to brew different quantities of coffee. You can set it for 2-4 cups (which lets it function as a single-serve coffee maker, brewing directly into a mug), 5-8 cups, or 9-12 cups. The machine adjusts how it heats and disperses the water to provide the same extraction across different volumes. The Oxo also has a removable showerhead that makes for easy cleaning, a very effective thermal carafe that utilizes a rubber tube running through it to aid in mixing and pouring coffee. It kept coffee at temperature for a little less than two hours, no hot plate needed (also no hot plate available on this machine).
Removable water tanks are so much more convenient than fixed reservoirs on the back of the machine. Unfortunately the Oxo has the latter.

Braun Brewsense Drip Coffee Maker
Amazon
Target
Williams Sonoma
Pros: Great value, adjustable hot plate temperature
Cons: Carafe feels flimsy
If you’re put off by the price point of machines like the Café and the Ratio, there is still hope for good tasting coffee. But the striking thing about testing budget drip coffee makers, which we’re defining as those that cost less than $100 at the time of writing, is just how different they actually are from one another. Some have nothing but a simple on-off switch, some brew at several different strengths. Some have thermal carafes, some do not. There are a whole range of different showerheads—some that dispense water in a tight spout, some that use a wide ring. Even the glass coffee pots open and close in very different ways. Our point here is that there really was something to test. And when we considered the quality of coffee together with the variety of features available, Braun’s Brewsense outpaced the field.
When we say “quality of coffee,” we should be clear: It’s not the same as what you’ll get if you use one of the $300-plus machines recommended above. The Braun doesn’t regulate water temperature as precisely as the Café; it doesn’t let the coffee bloom like the Ratio. It’s a more basic setup overall. But, especially when set side by side with some of the other budget machines, we could taste the difference. The Braun’s coffee wasn’t flat and it wasn’t stale. We liked that it offered two different coffee strengths that actually tasted different (regular and bold). What we liked even more was that the hot plate had variable settings—one of the biggest issues we’ve found with inexpensive coffee makers is that the coffee is often just too damn hot to drink and the hot plates can simmer it to death. Finally, the Braun offered the option to brew small amounts of coffee, one to four cups, and it delivered. This setting slows down the brewing process. If it isn’t used, water will run through the coffee grounds too quickly and won’t extract as much flavor. It also came with a charcoal water filter and the ability to program it to work with soft or hard water if you have either.
In terms of value, we were quite satisfied with the Braun, but if we were to nitpick, some of the other budget coffee makers had better designed carafes. The Braun’s flipped open a little too easily, making it spill-prone if you aren’t careful.
Size: 7.9" x 7.9" x 14.2"Capacity: 12 cupsCarafe style: GlassFeatures: 1-4 cup options, adjustable brew strength, programmable timer, water filter, adjustable hot plate temperatureWarranty: 3 years
The optimal brewing temperature for flavor extraction in coffee is between 195°F–205°F, so we looked for something with good temperature control in that range. (If you want to go down a geeky rabbit hole of learning more about temperature, extraction, and flow rate than is necessary for a simple coffee maker recommendation, the internet has a lot to offer.)
Ease of use is a huge factor in determining the best drip coffee makers. After all, if you want to mess around with a precise, intricate brewing process, you might as well make yourself a pour-over. We were looking for a machine that was easy to set up, simple to operate, yet still yielded a high-quality cup.
We wanted a machine that brewed coffee relatively quickly, within 5–7 minutes.
For example, does the coffee maker have an automatic timer so you can have fresh coffee waiting for you in the morning? Is there a single-serve function? Can it make iced coffee?
Drip coffee makers have lots of nooks and crannies and can be difficult to clean. Obviously, the easier to clean, the better. Bonus points for any carafe that is dishwasher-safe.
Warming plates work, but we think it’s better to have a carafe that keeps the coffee hot for an extended period of time. It should pour easily without leaking or spilling. It should feel good in your hand (and maybe look nice on your countertop too).
Most important, does the coffee actually taste good? Is it bitter? How’s the balance? Is the coffee nice and warm when it comes out of the coffee maker?
We ground 8 grams of a locally roasted coffee blend per 5-oz. cup of coffee in a burr grinder (except for the Grind and Brew where we only used the built-in grinder). Then we simply made pots of coffee in each machine. The capacity of the machines ranged from 6 to 14 cups. We brewed using the different strength settings for machines that offered them. For machines that came with thermal carafes, we poured coffee from them after one hour and again after two hours to see if the coffee stayed warm.

Ratio Six Coffee Maker
Ratio Coffee
Amazon
In the fall of 2021, the Ratio Six received its Golden Cup Certification from the SCA and that was absolutely no surprise. Not only is this machine sleek, modern, and beautifully designed, it also brews a wonderful cup of coffee, mimicking the pour-over method (and don’t be fooled by the name, it’s actually an 8-cup coffee maker). The water pump is designed with a wide showerhead for full saturation of the grounds and, like the Fellow and Oxo machines allows the coffee to bloom after the initial saturation—a heat shield placed over the brew basket helps maintain the optimal brewing temperature. Another nice feature? Indicator lights on the front of the machine show the step-by-step process, labeled Bloom, Brew, and Ready. The insulated thermal carafe keeps hot coffee hot for hours without a hot plate and it comes with a sealed lid that traveled on a short car trip without a spill. We don’t have anything bad to say about the Ratio, but it just doesn’t come with as many features as either Café machine.

Technivorm Moccamaster KBGV 10-Cup Coffee Maker
Amazon
Sur la Table
We’ll pour one out here for our former drip coffee maker champ from the days before Fellow and its ilk changed what it means to be a top quality automatic coffee brewer. The Moccamaster was the very first machine to receive the SCA Gold Cup Standard, and, as a result, set the standard for a higher level of drip coffee machine. It still makes a damn fine cup of coffee, but it lacks the features of the Fellow, Oxo, or even the Café machines we tested below while have a price tag that's just as high. And while it has a distinct design, we think some newer machines not only offer more, but look better on the counter as well. There's still much to recommend here: In 2021 the newest Moccamaster came out with the ability to brew “Gold Cup” coffee half a carafe at a time. That means that if you live solo or your partner is a tea drinker, you don’t need to make more coffee than you need in the morning. This is also a dead-simple machine to use. Besides the full carafe or half carafe brew cycles, it has nothing but an on-off switch.

Aarke Coffee Dripper
Aarke
The coffee dripper from the aesthetically-minded Aarke looks as nice on the counter as the rest of the brand's products like their rather glamorous soda maker. But it's not just a looker. It's an excellent coffee maker as well. It brews using the SCA golden cup specifications (and when paired with the Aarke burr grinder, automatically gets the coffee-to-water ratio just right), and has dead-simple single button operation. Since the machine does have a few functions, you can turn the bloom on and off for example, it would be nice if it had an extra switch or at least labeled what the button could do, but still, this is an easy-to-operate machine. The only reason it ends up in this section rather than with our top picks is that it costs a bit more than the Fellow Aiden and offers less functionality.

Café Specialty Grind and Brew Coffee Maker
Amazon
Williams Sonoma
Bed Bath & Beyond
When it comes to espresso machines, we don’t have a great affinity for machines with built-in grinders. That’s because they tend to be underpowered and frequently don’t feature enough variability to properly dial in a shot. For drip coffee, though? A built-in grinder can work just fine. The process isn’t nearly as finicky as espresso. Café's Grind and Brew is a machine that makes good use of its attached coffee grinder. It can grind directly into the reusable filter, and though it only has six settings, that’s enough to brew delicious coffee. The machine offers the ability to set the brewing temperature anywhere between 185℉ and 205℉, which lets you tweak the flavor of your pot. It has an easy-to-operate app if you’re into scheduling a brew from elsewhere in the house, and though it’s a larger machine, the separate side water tank is among the easiest to remove and fill. Finally, the thermal carafe keeps coffee hot for well over an hour. This has previously been a winner, and we still recommend it, but the Fellow Aiden can just do so much more it’s in a class by itself.

Café Specialty Drip Coffee Maker
Amazon
Williams Sonoma
Crate & Barrel
A previous top pick, this is still a fantastic, beautiful machine that will please hard-core coffee lovers. It’s been given the Golden Cup from the Specialty Coffee Association, meaning you can expect the same delicious coffee every time, made with the proper balance of water to coffee and brewing temperature. But you can also change the brew strength if you like, which is an excellent feature for folks who like customizing the heck out of their morning pot of coffee—you can choose from Gold, Light, Medium, Dark, or Bold, depending on your preferences. You can also set the precise water temperature (from a range of 185° to 205°F). The wide showerhead on the brewer ensures even distribution of water, and solid agitation of the grounds—both important for consistent extraction and flavor. But even with all those bells and whistles, the best feature on this machine might just be the replaceable carbon water filter that goes into the reservoir, ensuring every pot is brewed with filtered water for a consistent cup of coffee.

Technivorm Moccamaster KB
Williams Sonoma
Technivorm’s older Moccamaster KB 10-Cup Coffee Maker, is still available at a slightly lower price than the newer model. It remains iconic. While this isn’t a programmable coffee maker, it does make a well-extracted pot with just the flip of a switch. We tested a glass carafe model, but there is also a thermal stainless-steel option. Each Moccamaster is made with recyclable materials in the Netherlands and tested before being packed and shipped. It comes with a 5-year warranty, but the machines are known to last much longer, and the parts can easily be replaced should something happen. The design-minded among us should note that it’s available in a range of colors from red and lime green to a more classic polished silver. For those who don’t intend to make it the centerpiece of an otherwise empty counter, you’ll appreciate that its design makes it compact enough to fit into a tight corner.

Oxo On Barista Brain 9-Cup Coffee Maker
Amazon
Oxo’s Barista Brain is likely what most coffee drinkers think they are looking for in a drip coffee maker. Setting it up and using it is seamless compared to the Moccamaster, where the lids to the water reservoir and filter holder don’t connect to the machine. On this one both lids are connected and can easily be flipped open and shut. The Oxo has precise, temperature-controlled brewing—it keeps the water between 197.6°–204.8°F—and had about a 5-minute brewing time for a full pot of coffee. At the end of brewing, the Oxo had evenly distributed hot water over the coffee grounds. Its double-wall carafe keeps coffee warm for hours, although the opening is too narrow to fit your hand inside to clean, so you’ll need a bottle brush or similar solution to clean it properly. The bottom line: Can the Oxo brew good coffee? Yes, just not quite as good as the Golden Cup machines.

ZWILLING Enfinigy Glass Drip Coffee Maker
Amazon
Zwilling
Williams Sonoma
Like our other winners, the Zwilling Enfinigy Drip Coffee Maker has also been awarded the Golden Cup Standard by the SCA, and rightly so. The Zwilling brews coffee consistently well, and it has enough additional features to make it worth its higher price tag, but it doesn’t quite match the features offered by the Café, so the decision on which one to buy boils down (get it?) to what features are most important to you and what you’re willing to pay for them. This model stands out with a few novel options. The most curious one is a Bloom function that you can toggle on or off. Blooming coffee is an important step—when coffee is saturated with hot water, it immediately releases CO₂, which causes unpleasant tastes. Blooming coffee gives it a moment to release that gas before continuing the brewing process, eliminating unpleasant, sour tastes. It’s so fundamental we’re not really sure why you would toggle that step off, especially as it only adds 20 or so seconds to the total brew time. Even more curious was that this function was set to OFF by default.
Another cool feature lets you select your water hardness (there are three levels to choose from) and this then informs a timing function that tells you when it’s time to descale the machine. Apart from that, the features are fairly standard, allowing you to set a timer for when to start brewing, selecting the number of cups (from 2–12), and a keep warm function that automatically switches off after 30 minutes.

Mr. Coffee Perfect Brew
Amazon
We tested a couple Mr. Coffee machines and the Perfect Brew, which came out in 2024 is the biggest leap forward we've seen from the old standby brand. Like so many other new automatic coffee brewers, it uses the SCA golden cup standards in its brew settings. It's wonderfully slim, making it a good candidate for small apartment kitchens or even a dorm room of someone who likes a quality pot of coffee in the morning. The thing that Mr. Coffee seems to really be banking on with the Perfect Brew is its ability to make cold brew and iced coffee. We found those capabilities just so-so, with coffee that couldn't really compete with true immersion cold brew. But the hot coffee was lovely and the interface was easy to operate. If you have any history with the brand, the hardest thing to get over with this machine is probably the fact that a Mr. Coffee machine could cost up to $300.

Breville Precision Brewer Thermal Coffee Maker
Amazon
Breville
The Breville Precision Brewer had the most parts to deal with during the unboxing. It has all the added features you’d expect from a Breville—for example, it works as a cold-brew coffee maker too—but we didn’t love the design—the filter basket is rather bulky and the lid to the water tank doesn’t connect to the machine. Additionally, the water reservoir doesn’t drain all the water, leaving about a half-ounce of liquid in the tank at the end of a cycle. This is a small quirk but not one you expect on a $300 machine.

Chemex Ottomatic 2.0
Crate & Barrel
As fans of pour-over, we had expectations for the Chemex Ottomatic 2.0. Chemex, to many, is synonymous with the fussy brewing technique that snooty coffee connoisseurs (us included) prize over most other methods. So it was a little bit disappointing that this machine didn’t brew coffee quite to the same standard as the Café, Technivorm, and Ratio machines. The flavor extraction was pretty close to what you get brewing pour-over manually using the same coffee beans and grind size but, again, not as complex and full-flavored as the winning machines. The Ottomatic 2.0 looks sort of like a miniature outdoor shower, like you’d see at a beach, but if it were in a sci-fi movie. The showerhead does a great job of saturating the grounds, and the machine even starts and stops throughout the brewing process, helping to agitate the grounds, to mimic the pour-over process. Like the Moccamaster, it allows for a bloom period after the initial saturation. There are two modes on this machine, one that simply brews coffee and one that brews while keeping the hot plate active so your coffee stays warm. The hot plate was great—as advertised, it kept the coffee warm but not so hot that the flavor changed over time. It also has an auto shutoff that kicks in after 90 minutes. This machine is compatible with the 3-, 6-, and 8-cup models of Chemex carafe, as well as the 3- and 5-cup handblown models. If you don’t already have a carafe, Chemex offers a few bundles with different sizes.

Zojirushi  Zutto 5-Cup Drip Coffee Maker
Amazon
If you know Japanese brand Zojirushi, it is almost certainly for their top-of-the-line rice cookers. But they have a number of coffee products as well (for example, they make one of our favorite travel coffee cups). The Zutto isn't just a budget coffee maker, it's truly a cheap one. We've seen it for as little as $50. And if you have your heart set on getting a cheap coffee maker, we think you'll be happy with this one. It doesn't have any fancy features (or any features to speak of at all), but it is incredibly compact thanks to its design placing the brew basket inside the carafe. It has a removable showerhead that evenly saturates the grounds, making coffee that wasn't flat or flavorless like we got from lots of inexpensive machines.

Calphalon 14-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker
Amazon
Calphalon
Calphalon’s coffee maker offers the same features as the Braun minus the water filter and the water hardness settings, and the coffee was right on par with it as well. For all the reasons we recommend the Braun as a budget pick, we can also recommend the Calphalon without reservation. The Braun cost a bit less, and we preferred its interface, though, so it snagged the top spot.

Cuisinart Perfectemp
Amazon
Williams Sonoma
We tested two Cuisinart coffee makers. The Perfectemp brews a large quantity (14 cups) with little fanfare, but if you don’t usually make that much coffee at once, experts recommend smaller batches for the best flavor.

Mr. Coffee 10-Cup Programmable Coffee Machine
Amazon
Mr. Coffee machines get a bad rap, but if you step up from the most basic models you can get an adequate coffee maker. The coffee from this 10-cup model wasn’t great because it was a bit watery, but for the utilitarian coffee drinker it could get the job done. It also came with a thermal carafe that kept the coffee warm on the table for a couple hours. The last nice feature on the Mr. Coffee was a detachable water reservoir that was much cleaner to fill than the normal “pour the water in the back of the machine” method most inexpensive coffee makers rely on. Ultimately, the coffee was just better from the Braun and Calphalon machines, though. This was also the only budget machine we tested that didn’t come with a reusable filter.

Bonavita One-Touch
Amazon
The Bonavita One-Touch brews a nice cup of coffee, but there are some details that made it more awkward to use than other options. Instead of sliding the filter basket into a holder on the machine, you have to balance the filter basket on top of the thermal carafe before sliding the stacked parts under the showerhead. Then, after brewing is done, you have to remove the filter basket from the carafe in order to screw on the lid. Meanwhile, there’s no spot to set the filter basket on the machine while you’re pouring. None of this is what you want when you’re groggy in the morning or hurrying to run out the door.Cuisinart Classic Thermal

Cuisinart Classic Thermal
Best Buy
We found the Classic Thermal totally adequate—the coffee’s flavor was weaker and less developed than our top-ranking models, but the machine is fine if you’re looking for something to use occasionally.

Hamilton Beach BrewStation
Amazon
In the budget category, we tested the Hamilton Beach BrewStation, which brews coffee in an internal reservoir and dispenses it like a fountain soda. A strange feature, and one not worth experimenting with given that the coffee was subpar.

Ninja 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker
Walmart
Target
Ninja had been a previous winner in the budget category and came with a few nice features that the Braun and Calphalon both have, like two different brew strengths and the ability to brew smaller batches of coffee. But the coffee it made, even on the “bold” setting, was just less flavorful than its competitors.

Amazon Basics 12-Cup Digital Coffee Maker
Amazon
Basic is the right word here. Amazon’s entry to the drip coffee maker field delivers exactly what you’d expect of a coffee maker that costs $50, which is to say, forgettable but drinkable coffee. The only feature it comes with is a delay timer so you can set it to brew coffee ahead of time. The cost of all our budget picks only varies by about $30 or so, and we thought the results we got from several others made them better picks.

Black & Decker 12-Cup Coffee Maker
Amazon
The Black & Decker machine came with a nice thermal carafe, but that wasn’t enough to offset the fact that the coffee it made tasted dirty—as in, had the flavors of dirt. We wouldn’t rule out that there are people out there who like that kind of earthy coffee in the morning, but we didn’t consider it a winner in our tests.
The coffee brewer itself is just one part of the process. And while a drip coffee maker requires far less gear than, say, an espresso machine—a good set of paper filters is really all you need to get started—fresh beans are still a must. Epi contributor and longtime coffee educator and journalist Ever Meister has a good rundown of what to look for on a bag of coffee beans to know what exactly you’re getting.
First things first: Buy whole beans. Grinding coffee right before you brew is the key to a great cup, and so is having a good burr coffee grinder to do it. Of course, if you go with the Café Grind and Brew that’s taken care of for you.
There’s no shortage of coffee at the supermarket, but it’ll be up to you suss out the quality from the swill. When you buy directly from a roaster, you get knowledgeable staff and tasting opportunities. The coffee is probably fresher too. There are companies like Trade Coffee that have relationships with various roasters around the country, and a quietly growing “roasted at the source” movement from companies like Origin Roasted that offers even fresher beans that were never shipped green or unroasted and left to sit.
Pay attention to the roast date, which ideally should be marked on the bag, and buy it as close to the date as possible. The flavor flattens out quickly once you open it. “Coffee that’s of high quality, that’s been processed well, and is relatively fresh compared to when it was harvested, that coffee should taste really good within the first 30 days after roasting,” Jesse Kahn, who is in charge of training center development for Counter Culture coffee says. Beans from a roaster might have been roasted that same week. At the grocery store, roast dates of two or three months out are more likely.
Roast levels reflect how long and at what temperature the beans are roasted. There’s a prevailing theory that dark roasts mask lesser-quality coffee. Ultimately, the darker the roast, the smokier the flavor, which might or might not be your cup of, uh, tea. “When you roast, you’re eliminating moisture and caramelizing some of the sugars inherent in the coffee,” Kahn said.
There are dozens of coffee varieties from all over the world, and they’re all going to taste different. While Kahn said you can make some generalizations about the flavors of coffees from various regions, there are so many other factors at play. “The altitude, the soil composition, the rainfall, all the things that go into the piece of land where the coffee grows,” he said.
The bean matters as well. There are two main species of coffee bean: arabica and robusta. Arabica is generally considered to be much higher quality, and the vast majority of what you can buy is arabica. Beware anything that looks mass produced and isn’t labeled “arabica.” If you want to get a taste of what robusta is about, Nguyen Coffee Supply offers some interesting beans out of Vietnam, but even the very best robusta beans tend to taste heavier and grittier.
What we call coffee beans are the green seeds inside the fruits of the coffee tree. How the beans are processed plays a part in flavor and quality, said Kahn. If you see the processing method listed on a label, take that as a good sign.
In the wet or washed process, which is most common, the fruit is run through a machine to separate the pulp from the beans, which are then fermented in water so the rest of the gunk comes off and the beans can be dried. Fermentation can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days. Changes in flavor occur during this period “in the same way that kimchi fermented for two months tastes different than two weeks,” Kahn said.
In the dry process, the fruit is set out to dry naturally before being pulped to get at the beans, which imparts a “very distinct, fruity flavor,” he said.
Coffee tends to grow better at certain elevations. The higher up it is, the wider the swings in temperature from day to night, the longer a coffee plant takes to ripen—and the more time it has to draw nutrients from the soil and develop flavor, Kahn said.
That doesn’t mean all high-altitude coffees are superior or that you’ll like how they taste, but it’s another positive detail about whoever is producing your coffee. More and more roasters are including this information on their bags, so make sure to look for it.
At home, keep your coffee in an airtight, opaque container out of light. It’s fine to keep it in the bag, but seal it up as tight as possible. Using a vacuum sealed container like Fellow’s can extend the shelf life of your beans by as much a month, though. There’s no need to store your coffee in the freezer. Moisture will eventually creep in and ruin the flavor, Kahn said. Besides, you need to drink that coffee, not stockpile it. Provided you know how to brew it, go forth and brew while it’s fresh and at its best.

In November 2025 and February 2026, award-winning chef and restaurateur Chutatip "Nok" Suntaranon will lead 10-day, 9-night trips to Thailand. Nok will share her favorite dishes and memories with you on a journey home to Bangkok and southern Thailand. Indulge in extravagant meals at Michelin-starred restaurants and afternoon tea along the Chao Phraya River; learn how to prepare Thai dishes during a hands-on cooking class with one of Nok’s teachers; and enjoy Thai hospitality during a home-hosted dinner in Bangkok. Dine on fresh-caught seafood in an island fishing village; picnic in a secluded cave; and observe the colorful pageantry, drama, and music of Thai cultural traditions like the mythical Manohra dance and fire performance. Wend your way through the klongs (canals) of Bangkok and some of the world’s best street markets in Bangkok and Trang—Nok’s hometown.

TITLE: How to Safely Use Expired Milk
DATE: cooking

It’s no secret grocery prices have climbed in the last few years, and milk is no exception. In these inflated conditions, you may find yourself clamoring to finish a carton before its expiration date, to avoid pouring what might as well be liquid cash down the drain.
But here’s some good news: You don’t have to toss out your milk just because it’s past its expiration date. If you observe a few precautions, you can safely consume that expired milk. After all, an expiration date is essentially an educated guess from the manufacturer. Milk may last days beyond its predicted shelf life when stored below 40℉ (4℃). “It’s certainly possible milk might look, taste, and smell just fine, even after the expiration date,” Donald Schaffner, PhD, a food science professor at Rutgers University tells me.
And according to official guidance from the US Department of Agriculture, “if the [expiration] date passes during home storage, a product should still be safe and wholesome if handled properly until the time spoilage is evident.”
If your milk doesn’t smell or look funky after the stamped expiration date has passed, it’s likely safe to consume. If you want to be extra cautious, says Schaffner, boil it before putting it to another use. In any case, you’ll want to use it as quickly as possible, before the narrow window between usable and actively spoiled (see: funky) passes.
Wary of pouring it straight up into your next bowl of cereal? Cooking or baking with expired milk (in recipes that reach 165℉ or above) are both efficient means of using up the stuff and killing any bacteria in the process. Put that half-gallon toward a cake, a creamy soup, or perhaps a tray of muffins for Sunday brunch. Make dulce de leche from scratch. Live a little and braise some pork in it! If you can’t find an immediate use, freeze it in portions to call upon for soups or baking projects to come.
Spoiled milk is not synonymous with sour milk. While certain bacteria can cause milk to turn sour (that is, to turn acidic and curdle, similar to recipes that instruct you to add a splash of vinegar to fresh milk), “spoiled milk” may carry any number of contaminants. According to Schaffner, there’s no way to know what they are without proper testing.
Often, milk is spoiled by a microorganism called Pseudomonas, which “does not really lead to souring,” Schaffner tells me, ”but more so to off flavors.” Long story short: It’ll simply taste gross. That’s why we can’t recommend using spoiled milk as a buttermilk substitute, as some other outlets might. Unless you know what you’re working with, you could end up with some pretty gnarly biscuits.
One potential beneficiary of your expired milk? Your garden. Plants love to soak up calcium as much as our bones do, and milk’s antifungal properties are thought to mitigate mildew in your outdoor garden too. The Spruce suggests mixing surplus milk with water in a 1:1 solution, pouring it into a spray bottle, and applying it sparingly to the leaves of your plant or the soil immediately surrounding it. Fortifying your plants and eliminating food waste in the process? A win-win, we’d say.
So, before you dump your dairy, eyes averted from the scene of the crime, consider the potential in that gallon. Your wallet, your cake, and your plants will thank you.

TITLE: Your Knife Holder Should Be Magnetic

You’ve done away with those blunt-as-a-butter-spreader knives you’ve been using since college and invested in some quality blades. You’ve got your knife sharpening routine down pat. You’ve finally taught your roommate to never put your knives in the dishwasher. If all of these things are true and you’re still tossing your prized cutlery into a kitchen drawer, you’re undoing all that good work.
You and your knives both deserve better, so consider this your wake-up call. Storing knives properly isn’t just a tenet of good kitchen organization practices—knives that have a proper home will stay sharper longer, extending their lifespan and saving you the hassle of constant sharpening.
While the best way to store your knives depends a bit on your kitchen setup and personal preferences, there are some methods you should definitely avoid. One is stashing them loose in an unlined drawer, where they’re bound to get damaged or hurt someone. Another is a traditional slotted knife block. That may seem like a bold claim, but let me explain: A wooden knife block’s slots are nearly impossible to clean, which means they become receptacles for grime and dust over time. Knife blocks can also be limiting—unless your array of knives perfectly aligns with the number of slots your block has, you may end up with extra slots you have no use for, or find you don’t have enough slots to fit your entire knife collection.
When we polled the Bon Appétit staff about the best way to store knives, we learned that this opinionated bunch can indeed agree on something: The best knife storage solutions for most kitchens include some sort of magnet. This can take a couple forms, which we’ll get into below. And if you’re absolutely married to storing your blades in a drawer, we’ve got a few recommendations for that too.
Choose this type of knife storage if: You have no counter or drawer space to spare
A wall-mounted magnetic strip was the overwhelming winner when I asked my fellow BA staffers how they prefer to store their knives.
What makes this solution a favorite for amateur home cooks and pro chefs alike? For one, it allows you to store knives of all shapes and sizes without worrying about the number and length of built-in slots you have in a knife block. This makes them an ideal option for people whose knife collections include a medley of santokus, cleavers, nakiris, paring knives, and boning knives—you can even store your kitchen shears on these things.
Another pro? Magnetic strips take up zero kitchen counter or drawer space (a major win in small kitchens especially). They also couldn’t be easier to clean with a quick wipe down.
The only real downside to this type of knife storage is that it’s not the most renter-friendly solution, as most models are designed to be drilled into a wall. As a workaround for those who are power-tool averse, Bon Appétit creative development director Ian Stroud tells us you can use heavy duty Command strips to affix your magnet to the wall, but you’ll need to select adhesives with a high weight limit.
It’s also worth considering whether you want an all-metal strip or one with a wooden exterior. Wood is a softer service than stainless steel and therefore can help protect your knives from wear caused by scraping against the strip. The downside is that not all wooden magnetic strips are created equal. Senior cooking and SEO editor Joe Sevier notes that he once bought one where the magnets were not evenly spaced throughout the length of the strip, which meant there were areas that couldn’t support the weight of his knives.

Jonathan Alden Magnetic Wooden Knife Bar
Amazon
Etsy
This wood option from Jonathan Alden has a single magnetic strip running through it (to help prevent a repeat of Joe’s experience). It’s lightweight and comes in a variety of lengths, and you can choose between walnut or cherry wood.

Modern Innovations Stainless Steel Magnetic Knife Bar
Amazon
If you’re on a budget or prefer the look of an all-metal strip, opt for the Modern Innovations Knife Bar. It’s been Ian’s model of choice for years, and performed just as well as a strip twice its price when I tested it. It comes in sizes ranging from 10"–24" in length and will run you $16–$33, depending on which you choose.
Choose this type of storage if: You’re emotionally attached to having a freestanding block
If you lack wall space or are highly attached to the idea of having a knife block on your counter, a magnetic knife stand is another great storage solution that allows for flexibility and easy cleaning, all while protecting your blades from damage. Your knives go on the outside of these narrow, freestanding blocks, which typically have wooden exteriors and magnetic cores.

Zwilling Slanted Magnetic Knife Block
Zwilling
Williams Sonoma
This model from Zwilling combines the form of a traditional slotted knife block with the functionality you get from a magnetic stand. It’ll take up a bit more countertop real estate, but can hold an impressive 10 knives and is the most secure option of the ones listed in this section.

Marcellin Magnetic Acacia Knife Block

Made In Knife Block

These are the three models I would recommend if you’re opting for a typical magnetic knife stand. They all contain ultra-strong magnets to grip whatever assortment of knives you have at home (each block fits approximately 6–8 knives depending on the model). Choosing between them ultimately comes down to which best fits your kitchen, stylistically and literally. If you’re tight on counter space, the Marcellin is the narrowest of the bunch at less than 3" wide. It also has the largest capacity thanks to its curved sides, which can hold up to seven knives each.
Choose this type of storage if: You have a lot of drawer space and can’t stand the sight of cluttered countertops
I’ll say it again for the folks in the back: Some form of magnetic knife holder is really the best way to go. But some people are married to keeping their knives tucked away in a drawer for one reason or another. If that’s you, don’t fret. I’ve found some excellent in-drawer organizers that will serve you well. These can all hold both large chef’s knives and smaller paring or steak knives and can fit a 10.5" bread knife comfortably.

Made In Knife Organizer
Made In
A wooden drawer insert will be the most forgiving on your knives, and this model from Made In is the one senior commerce editor Noah Kaufman uses in his home. He likes that it’s got grippy feet on all four corners to keep it steady, a cross bar that keeps most large knives supported without putting weight on the blade, and magnets on each side that allow you to tack on a three-piece extension if need be.

Oxo Good Grips Compact Knife Organizer
Amazon
This plastic organizer from Oxo is handy because the slotted tray can be removed for easy cleaning. It fits up to five small knives and four large knives, which is a smaller capacity than the magnetic models above but still large enough to accommodate most home cooks’ knife collections.

Misen Modular Knife Storage 5-Piece Set
Misen
This model from Misen is particularly nifty because it’s modular. You can buy a three-, five-, or nine-piece set to get you started, and then purchase additional pieces individually as your knife collection grows. The whole thing is magnetized, which helps each piece click together easily and keeps your knives secure.
