TITLE: The unexpected wine country you need to visit: New Mexico
DATE: 
URL: https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/new-mexico-unexpected-wine-country
CONTENT:
Hispanic and Native American wine producers cultivate vineyards at high altitude and on desert plains in this southwestern state, making for some unique cellar-door visits.
Framed by the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in the north and the Chihuahuan Desert in the south, the US’s fifth-largest state is a land of rolling sand dunes, prehistoric petroglyphs, fairytale caves and dormant volcanoes. Equally as diverse as the topography is the culture, which reflects the history of the Indigenous, Hispanics and Anglo Americans who have coexisted in New Mexico for centuries. You’re most likely to first encounter this diversity through the cuisine — a bright and colourful melange of Native American, Mexican and Spanish flavours makes it one of the state’s biggest draws. But with fiery green chilli stew and billowing, fluffy frybread demanding attention, the story of one item at the table is easily overlooked: wine.
Long before Californians planted their first vineyards, New Mexico was growing grapes. A Native American pueblo just south of Albuquerque was the first recorded site of a vineyard in the state, established by two Franciscan monks in 1629. By 1880, more than 3,000 acres of vineyards were producing 908,000 gallons of wine, making New Mexico the fifth-largest wine producer in the country. Over the next century, New Mexico’s wine production declined due to a series of devastating floods, coupled with the rise of competitors like California. Wineries began resurfacing in the 1970s and by the new millennium, New Mexico was producing nearly one million gallons of wine. The industry has continued to grow ever since — yet it remains little known among international wine-lovers.
That’s partly because very few of New Mexico’s 56 wineries export overseas. Around 85% are small businesses, producing fewer than 7,000 cases a year. This makes tasting New Mexico’s wines an experience worth travelling for. Winemakers here take pride in the personal touch they bring to cellar door experiences, even as the industry continues to grow — informal conversations around a glass of wine make tasting sessions feel like you’re being hosted in someone’s home. Community spirit among the winemakers is strong, too, thanks to the challenges of working in such remote, rugged environments.

Today, you’ll find wineries across the state’s vast range of ecosystems. The most prolific area is between Albuquerque and the Texas border, where the southern grape-growing regions of the Middle Rio Grande Valley and Mimbres Valley are home to 85% of the state’s wineries. Here, warm days and cool nights create ideal conditions for growing Italian varietals like Sangiovese and Montepulciano. The easiest place to try New Mexico’s wines is the state capital of Albuquerque, with its high concentration of tasting rooms around the Old Town Plaza and access to picturesque vineyards within an hour’s drive of the city.
One of the most interesting winemaking regions is set around the town of Taos in the north, where travellers get to see first-hand the adventurous spirit of New Mexico’s winemakers growing grapes — such as Merlot and Riesling — at high altitude. Inhabited by Native Americans since 1450, Taos is today a hub for alpine sports enthusiasts and spiritual wellness seekers — but it’s also the ideal place for tasting the full-bodied, complex wines of New Mexico’s northernmost wine region. On the way there from Albuquerque, you’ll pass prehistoric adobe buildings, Native American pueblos and old Spanish settlements where wine grapes have been grown for centuries. As you climb from the desert to the mountains and notice the temperature drop, it’s not hard to imagine the obstacles wineries face at 7,000ft — frost kill, a shorter growing season and hail, to name just a few.
“Since New Mexico’s demographics are already diverse, the industry is diverse,” says Chris Goblet, executive director of New Mexico Wine, a nonprofit company working to promote and protect the state’s wine. New Mexico has one of the highest percentages of Hispanics in the US — 49.78% in 2024, according to the World Population Review — and travellers can see this reflected in the cellar door experience at local vineyards, where they can taste wines crafted by Native American, female and Hispanic winemakers.
You can savour Spanish slow-roasted pig at the rustic cellar door of Las Nueve Niñas Winery in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, or sip wine while watching a flamenco performance in one of Vara Winery’s three contemporary tasting rooms — two in Albuquerque and one in Santa Fe. Elsewhere, while gazing out at the jagged peaks of Barrancos Blancos mountain from Vivác Winery in Dixon, visitors can taste the smooth, berry-forward chokecherry wine, made in partnership with Robert Mirabal, a Grammy Award-winning Native American musician.

TITLE: Where to try the 6 traditional dishes served on ‘No Taste Like Home with Antoni Porowski’
DATE: 
URL: https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/family-dishes-no-taste-like-home
CONTENT:
These traditional family recipes each tell a story about ancestral heritage. Here's how you can try each one—from tortellini en brodo in Italy to jajangmyeon in South Korea.
In National Geographic’s series No Taste Like Home with Antoni Porowski, six Hollywood stars follow the Queer Eye star on a journey through food and time as they travel through their ancestral homelands in search of family history. Starting with just one homemade family recipe, Porowski helps stars Awkwafina, Justin Theroux, Issa Rae, James Marsden, Florence Pugh, and Henry Golding connect with their pasts by eating foods that fed their ancestral lineages and exploring the places they once called home.
(Related: Antoni Porowski wants you to learn about your ancestors—through their recipes.)
With its roots in Northern China, jajangmyeon is among Korea’s most popular dishes, available at thousands of restaurants across the world alongside dozens of instant and frozen versions at grocery stores. The dish, recognizable by its signature glossy, midnight hue, is a variation of the Chinese dish zhajiangmian that migrant workers from Shandong brought to Korea in the late 19th century.
Jajangmyeon is a rich yet hearty dish, typically made with wheat noodles, ground or diced meat and/or seafood, vegetables (like zucchini or cabbage), and aromatics including ginger and garlic, and chunjang, the sweet-savory caramelized black bean paste that gives the dish its distinctive black shade.
The dish is so well-known and beloved that it plays a starring role in the unofficial Korean holiday, Black Day, on April 14, when single people celebrate or commiserate their singledom with friends over a bowl of jajangmyeon.
Where to try it in Korea: Almost anywhere. This dish is so ubiquitously known and loved that there are tens of thousands of places to find it in Seoul alone, but the Chinese restaurant Ehwawon (이화원) in Yeonhui-dong has been perfecting its silky version for three generations.

Traditionally found in cities like Bologna and Modena in Italy’s Emilia-Romagna region, tortellini en brodo is a regional specialty, highlighting the quality and history of its ingredients. This dish should not be confused with tortelli (this dish’s larger namesake), tortelloni (also larger but with different fillings and preparation), or ravioli (different shape, different fillings).
Tortellini is pint-sized, barely an inch big, and folded into chubby rings stuffed with a mixture of meat, like prosciutto or mortadella, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and nutmeg. Once filled and folded, the tortellini is simmered in a golden broth made traditionally with capon, a castrated male chicken, or a mixture of chicken and beef bones and served to float in the savory soup.
Where to try it in Italy:  Some of the best examples of regional cuisine, including tortellini en brodo, can be found at Trattoria di via Serra or All’Osteria Bottega in Bologna. Both restaurants are mentioned in the Michelin Guide’s Bologna Restaurants, with Trattoria di via Serra receiving a coveted Bib Gourmand award.

This okra and seafood stew is one of Western Africa’s most popular dishes and is usually found in many of the countries along the Atlantic coast from Senegal to Guinea. Born from the region’s rich fishing traditions, this stew uses a multitude of fish, fresh and dried shellfish, okra, peppers, and other aromatics simmered in candy-apple red palm oil. Once simmered and reduced, this thick stew is often served family-style over rice.
Though this dish might be unfamiliar at first for many diners outside Africa and the African diasporas, you’ve likely eaten or heard of its later incarnation. If you’ve ever visited New Orleans or the Creole regions of the world, soupe kanja is the progenitor for one of this cuisine’s most iconic dishes: gumbo.
Where to try it in Senegal: In Dakar, the family-owned Chez Loutcha is a popular and colorful local haunt that serves Senegalese staples alongside Cape Verdian and other menu items.
(Related: Drumbeats and heartstrings: tuning in to the rhythms of Senegal.)
Chicken with mushrooms and bamboo possibly gets its influence from multiple sources. The first, manuk pansuh—or chicken cooked in a bamboo stalk with tapioca or cassava leaves—is a staple of Sarawak cuisine and is often prepared during festivals by the Iban and the Bidayuh peoples. The meat is typically seasoned with aromatics like torch ginger, galangal, and lemongrass before being stuffed into the bamboo.
The second influence comes by way of Malaysia’s significant Chinese population, which has existed across Malaysia and the Indonesian archipelago as early as the 13th century. Various versions of a dish featuring chicken with mushrooms and bamboo shoots can be found in both China and Malaysia and are made with ingredients that would be easy to source in the mountainous regions of both countries.
Where to try it in Borneo: Serving Sarawak cuisine for more than a decade, Lepau Restaurant in Kuching showcases dishes from numerous indigenous communities, including Iban, Kelabit, Ulu, Bidayuh, and beyond, offering diners a rich entry point into this region’s most celebrated foods.

Like many recipes from the 18th and 19th centuries, shepherd’s pie was a way for families with little money or access to expensive ingredients, like prime cuts of meat, to stretch what they had to feed the household. First referred to as cottage pie in the late 18th century, this dish has changed very little from its original recipe and still features many of the same ingredients.
Ingredients for this British dish include ground beef or lamb/mutton (a fairly accessible ingredient for the sheep farming region in this dish’s early days) and diced vegetables in a rich gravy. One of shepherd’s pie's distinct identifiers is its pillowy mashed potato topping, which is spooned atop the hearty meat mixture and baked to crisp, golden brown perfection.
Where to try it in the UK: The Ivy restaurant has posted its iconic version of shepherd's pie online for people who are unable to make the trip to the restaurant, located in London.

This simple and beloved Southern American diner classic has changed very little from its European ancestors. Similar to Austria’s wiener schnitzel, chicken-fried steak is just that, typically a thin cut of beef, often a tenderized cube steak, dredged in flour and eggs before frying. The breading and frying technique gives the dish its signature name, though technically, pan-frying instead of deep-frying would make this dish “country-fried”.
German and Austrian immigrants who migrated to Texas in the 19th century and later became cattle farmers are believed to have brought chicken-fried steak to the United States. It’s one of the tastes of home these communities carried with them to America, says rancher Jim Kearney. “Food is the last thing to go,” says Kearney. “That’s what people hold onto as a symbol of their former life or wherever they came from.”
Where to try it in Texas: Dallas’ original farm-to-table Celebration Restaurant has perfected its grass-fed, chicken-fried steak for more than 50 years. Make sure to order it with the house specialty spicy jalapeno gravy.

TITLE: China’s other great wall is impressive, too—and steeped in history
DATE: 
URL: https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/xian-great-wall-china-alternative
CONTENT:
The 8.5-mile-long wall that surrounds Xi’an, touted as one of the best-preserved walled fortifications in China, could be the next UNESCO World Heritage site.
It’s the weekend of the mid-autumn festival in Xi’an, and all roads seem to lead to the south gate of the city's wall. In China’s central province of Shaanxi, Xi’an is primarily known for the museum that houses the army of terra-cotta warriors commissioned by China’s first ruler to protect him in his afterlife. But the wall, on this Saturday evening, is where all the action is.
Families are taking an evening stroll, complete with laughing, screaming children. There are vendors and buskers, tourists on bicycles, food stalls, and souvenir shops. Couples wearing regal red robes are wilting under the strobe lights for bridal photoshoots. Meanwhile, other photographers are capturing dozens of young women dressed up in flowy hanfu – traditional costumes from the Tang era that are suddenly in vogue among China’s youth.
Dozens of ornate watchtowers, turrets, parapets, and pavilions are scattered along the length of the wall. As dusk falls and the red lanterns and lights come on, the whole scene assumes a fairytale vibe.
When people mention 'wall' in the context of China, it is generally assumed to refer to the mammoth structure known as the Great Wall of China. But there are dozens, if not hundreds, of city walls throughout the country, in Beijing, Nanjing, Fenghuang, Pingyao, and Xi’an, among others. “The word for city in China, cheng / 城 means walled city,” says Kenneth Swope, professor of history at the University of Southern Mississippi and expert on imperial Chinese military history.
Yinong Cheng, professor at the School of History and Archival Studies at Yunnan University, adds that city walls tended to perform three main functions: defense, flood protection, and show of imperial might.
Several of these city walls, dating back to the Ming and Qing Dynasties, are now on UNESCO’s tentative list of heritage sites. The Xi’an wall—originally built during the Tang era (618 – 907 C.E.) and later expanded by the Ming dynasty from 1370 onwards—is considered the most complete and well-preserved. The wall runs for 8.5 miles (13.7 km) and measures 40 feet (12 meters) in height and 49 feet (15 meters) in width. Four main gates face each cardinal direction, and there are 14 minor gates in between, and a moat surrounds it.
Swope also says that the more powerful the rulers, the higher and more impressive the walls. This certainly makes sense for Xi’an (formerly Chang’an), an important city through early imperial times, serving as capital for the Han, Sui, and Tang dynasties. Xi’an is also the starting point of the network of trading routes known as the Silk Road. It was a planned city, built as a perfect grid with the wall enclosing it in a complete, rectangular loop. Even today, for some, it is possible to walk the entire length of the wall without a break.
“It was always a significant post not only for commercial transactions but also diplomatic transactions. There is no doubt that Chang'an was already walled in early imperial times, say, by the third-second century B.C.E.,” says Hilde De Weerdt, a professor of Chinese and Modern Global History at KU Leuven in Belgium. “So, when we say this is a 14th century wall, it is the earliest moment that we know of any (significant) renovation.”
The reason for the wall’s grandeur stems from Chang’an’s strategic importance combined with the Ming dynasty’s need to project their stately authority through such structures. “I can't actually think of a foreign invasion that would have warranted this (wall), because it's not even near any major border,” says Dr Lars Laamann, Assistant Professor of History at SOAS University of London. According to Swope, the Ming era was the pinnacle of “imperial architecture,” which gave us landmarks like the Forbidden City and the Temple of Heaven in Beijing. Coming right after the nomadic Mongols, the Ming rulers saw these walls as a way to rebuild Chinese pride.
The original purpose of these walls may have been to contain the cities or the populace within the perimeter. But over time, the towns grew beyond these boundaries, turning these walls into midtown anachronisms. From the top of the Xi’an wall, the sights and sounds of modern life are inescapable—skyscrapers and neon lights, honking cars and scurrying pedestrians. After the terra-cotta army, the wall is now one of Xi’an’s most popular tourist attractions. It has welcomed hundreds of famous visitors, including Bill Clinton, Michelle Obama, and Mark Zuckerberg, who went for a rain-soaked run on the wall's walkway.
The Xi’an wall faced the threat of demolition during the 1950s as part of the country’s Great Leap Forward narrative. Cheng says that even though widespread demolition started even earlier, towards the end of the Qing era (circa 1912), the wall stayed mostly intact, thanks to Xi’an’s status as an ancient historic capital. The real challenge came later.
“The story of conservation takes us from the Ming era to Mao Zedong,” says Dr Laamann, referring to the renowned architectural historian couple Lin Huiyin and Liang Sicheng. “It was a power struggle within the Communist Party, when one faction wanted to get rid of old medieval structures in the country, because they thought in the modern world, there was no place for such remnants of the past.” Lin and Liang fought to preserve the city walls everywhere—they lost in Beijing but won in Xi’an.
De Weerdt points out that the struggle between conservation and modernization is universal, citing the example of medieval walls in France and Italy torn down in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. “A lot of what we see in the Xi’an wall today is rebuilt with modern materials and modern ways of thinking,” she explains. However, this version of the wall integrates the cultural angle with the social: locals and tourists alike get to appreciate the city’s heritage while also using it as an urban public space.
Xi’an is connected to all major cities in China, so travelers can get there by plane and high-speed train. You can also fly directly into Xi’an’s Xianyang International Airport from a few cities in Asia, such as Hong Kong, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur, and Beijing. When you arrive in Xi’an, you can navigate the city easily on foot or by metro.

TITLE: 5 of the best wineries on the Gran Canaria Wine Route
DATE: 
URL: https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/paid-content-best-wineries-on-gran-canaria-wine-route
CONTENT:
Gran Canaria’s diverse landscapes and distinct microclimate allow for excellent grape-growing. Journey along this wine trail to find the region's best vineyards, bodegas and restaurants, as well as outstanding views.
Gran Canaria might not be the first place you think of when it comes to wine, but vines have been growing here since the Spanish colonised the island in the 15th century. Due to the island's distinctive microclimate and volcanic soils, grapes grow incredibly well, and the Canarian archipelago lays claim to 18 unique grape varieties, including the famous Malvasía Aromática — featured in some of Shakespeare’s famous works. Though red varieties make up about 70% of Gran Canaria's wine production, connoisseurs should keep an eye out for local white, rosé, sparkling and sweet wines, too. The best way to sample them? By taking to the trail on the Gran Canaria Wine Route — the only official wine route in the Canary Islands — which includes vineyards, bodegas, bars and restaurants that produce or serve local wines. Here are five of the best stops.
Gran Canaria’s vineyards can typically be found either in the low-lying north of the island or its mountainous centre. It doesn’t get more cloud-reaching than Bodegas Bentayga, which, at 4,232ft above sea level, is the island’s highest winery. It’s well worth traversing the twisting mountain roads for both the views and the vines. The winery here produces the renowned Agala red and white wines, the names of which correspond to the altitude at which the grapes were grown. Among these grape varieties are the interesting Vijariego Negro, used for their Tinto Barrica 1175 (featuring notes of cherry, cranberry and cassis), and Vijariego Blanco Diego, which goes into the fresh and fruity Blanco Altitud 1318 (with notes of green apple, lime and fennel).
Don’t miss: Less than a 30-minute drive away is Roque Bentayga. This soaring monolith was the final stronghold for the island’s Indigenous people until the arrival of Castilian troops at the end of the 15th century. You can walk close to the summit, where you’ll spot mysterious engravings on the rock that still baffle experts today.
In the island’s north east, you’ll find the handsome village of Santa Brígida and Finca Escudero. This idyllic estate doesn’t only grow grapes, but also has an extensive olive grove with Arbequina and Picual varieties, which are used to make the estate's signature peppery olive oil. Interestingly, Finca Escudero is one of the only vineyards on the island where the main grape variety isn’t native to the Canaries. The vineyard primarily grows the classic Spanish Tempranillo grape, which is used to produce rioja. The vineyard has recently planted some Canarian Marmajuelo grapes, so white wines using this variety should be ready to try soon. These wines are typically fresh, with flavours of melon and grapefruit.
Don’t miss: Every weekend, Santa Brígida — a spot popular with tourists back in Victorian times — hosts an agricultural market where you’ll find wine and homebrewed beers, as well as a variety of cheeses and preserves. Nearby is the Casa del Vino, a small museum and restaurant that serves local wines and typical Canarian plates, such as gofio escaldado — a mix of toasted corn flour, fish stock and fresh mint often served with large slices of red onion that can be used in place of spoons to scoop up the dish.
Founded in 1912, Bodega San Juan has been in the same family for five generations and is one of the oldest wineries on the island. It’s located near Bandama, formally known as Monte Lentiscal, the oldest wine region of Gran Canaria. The volcanic topsoil in this area, a mixture of tiny stone and ash granules known as picón, allows for excellent vine drainage and imparts mineral properties to the wines. San Juan’s Mocanal red wine is a blend of the classic Canarian grape varieties Listán Negro (which brings out notes of sour cherry, raspberries and black pepper) and Negramoll (providing red berry flavours).
Don’t miss: On a guided tour of the vineyard, you’ll not only get to taste the wines, but also look around the impressive estate. This includes an intriguing wine museum where you can learn about processes of wine-making that date back more than a century.
This 40-year-old family-run winery is all about the gastronomic experience. Not only does Bodega La Montaña produce a range of environmentally responsible wines, including an excellent sweet white wine, but they also run a bochinche — a pop-up vineyard restaurant that typically opens around the end of the grape harvest. Along with wine tastings, you can enjoy classic Canarian cuisine, such as garbanzada (chickpea stew) and papas arrugadas (salted, wrinkly potatoes) along with their homemade wines. It’s about as authentic as you can get in these parts and incredibly good value.
Don’t miss: Each weekend, the nearby town of San Mateo comes alive with two markets — one agricultural (selling fruit, vegetables, pastries, flowers and more) and one craft (selling aloe vera products, traditional handicrafts etc). The latter is the ideal place for picking up a souvenir.
The largest winery on the island, Las Tirajanas is run like a cooperative, with 17 family-operated vineyards located around the island contributing grapes. These vineyards experience different microclimates and are located across varied landscapes — in the south, vineyards are surrounded by palm groves and olive trees, while vineyards in the island's midlands are located at high-altitude on volcanic slopes. There are 11 different wines to choose from here, including a crisp, fruity rosé made with Listán Negro grapes, packed full of bright raspberry flavours. Like many Canarian wines, you’ll find this variety is best drunk young to make the most of the ripe fruit notes. Guided tours and tastings are available from Tuesday to Saturday.
Don’t miss: Gran Canaria has been designated as a Starlight Tourist Destination due to its clear, dark skies. On the main road from Bodega Las Tirajanas to Maspalomas, you’ll come across the Mirador Astronómico de la Degollada de las Yeguas, a perfect spot for stargazing when the sun goes down.
