2023’s beloved RoboCop: Rogue City is getting a sequel later this year. Developer Teyon revealed a follow-up to its love letter to Paul Verhoeven’s original RoboCop on Thursday, and the studio’s new game is giving big Dredd energy.
RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business, described as a “standalone extension set after the events” of Rogue City, will send players into a towering, OCP-built housing complex which has been taken over by heavily armed mercenaries. RoboCop must fight his way to the top of that deadly fortress in his ongoing mission to protect the innocent and uphold the law.
Unfinished Business will feature the same first-person gameplay from RoboCop: Rogue City, but will introduce new enemies and weapons. RoboCop must now face flying drones and anti-personnel turrets, as well as armored creeps wielding massive miniguns. Also new? Katana-wielding cyborgs and jet packs, according to the game’s official description, which could potentially retraumatize franchise fans who have seen RoboCop 3. ED-209 is also back, of course.
Robo will have new tools to take down his targets, however, including a Cryo Cannon — and apparently some exploding icy barrels — with which to literally freeze his foes.
While the main component of RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business appears to be inspired by action movies like Dredd and The Raid series, there appear to be other missions included in the new game. Players will also take on the role of Alex Murphy, before he became RoboCop, in “unique missions with familiar faces which reveal more of the storyline of Unfinished Business,” Nacon says. Peter Weller is back to voice Murphy/RoboCop.
RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business, is slated for release on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X this summer. As a stand-alone game, it won’t require owning the original RoboCop: Rogue City, which is currently on sale for $9.99.

TITLE: How to behave in a Japanese arcade without looking like a tourist

Sega’s new website is an English-language guide to finding and enjoying Japan’s game centers
by  Chris Plante
Visiting Japan without stopping at a game center is like flying to Rome and forgetting to eat pasta. Unlike America, where arcades peaked with that scene in Terminator 2 in which a grown man stiff-arms the kid from Salute Your Shorts, the game center remains a popular hangout spot in Japan’s major cities. However, much has changed about arcades in those intervening decades, leaving some visitors confused by unfamiliar titles and a galaxy of crane games. That’s assuming they can even find an arcade to begin with.
Luckily, Sega just launched a website that serves as a guide for the gaikokujin. The Japanese Game Centers Guide includes an explanation of six different types of machines, recommendations for guest etiquette, tips for winning prizes, and a Google Map with dozens of game center locations.
I’m particularly sweet on the site’s blunt instructions for playing a crane game:
Yes, that’s a bit obvious. But Sega’s site includes a bunch of other tips I wish I’d known before my first visit to a Japanese game center. Like, if you want to take pictures or record videos, ask the arcade staff for permission first. Or, if you’re struggling to win a crane game, let the staff know, and they might adjust the position of the prize to make things a bit easier.
Three years ago, Sega sold what remained of its brick-and-mortar arcade business to Genga. The company’s iconic blocky logo would no longer watch over the millions of annual visitors in iconic gaming spots like the streets of Akihabara and Den-Den-Town. However, the company still produces a bulk of the machines that serve as the lifeblood of arcade centers. Perhaps that’s why they made a beautiful reference guide with clutch warnings like, “Some arcades do not allow men to use purikura booths alone.”
You can surf the entire game center guide at this link. Now if Sega could put together a detailed explainer on how to beat Arm Champs 2 then I would have all the tools required to make my next trip to Tokyo a success.

TITLE: AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Review
DATE: 
URL: https://ign.com/articles/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-review
CONTENT:
For the last couple of generations, AMD has been desperately trying to compete with Nvidia at the high end. However, now, with the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT, Team Red has ceded the ultra-high-end to the RTX 5090 and is instead focused on making the best graphics card for the majority of gamers – a goal it absolutely achieves.

The AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT is a $599 graphics card that trades blows with the $749 GeForce RTX 5070 Ti. That alone sets it up as one of the best GPUs on the market today – but AMD further sweetens the deal with FSR 4, finally bringing AI upscaling to an AMD graphics card for the first time. Simply put, this is the graphics card to get for 4K gaming, especially if you don’t have $1,999 to mindlessly blow on the RTX 5090.
The AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT is now available, starting at $599. However, keep in mind that prices can fluctuate, as there will be plenty of third-party cards that cost more. Try to find one under $699, though.
The AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT is built on the RDNA 4 architecture, and while it brings improvements to its shader cores, the real stars of the show are the new RT and AI Accelerators. The AI Accelerators, in particular, are the driving force behind FidelityFX Super Resolution 4, or FSR 4, which brings AI upscaling to AMD graphics cards for the first time. This new AI upscaling doesn’t necessarily improve framerates over games using the older FSR 3.1 model, but it greatly improves accuracy – meaning better image quality. Luckily, if you care more about the framerates, there’s a nice little toggle in the Adrenalin software that lets you turn off FSR 4 entirely.
But it’s more than just AI upscaling. AMD has also made huge improvements to its shader cores, resulting in better performance on a per-core level. So, despite the Radeon RX 9070 XT having 64 Compute Units, compared to 84 in the previous-generation Radeon RX 7900 XT, AMD was able to deliver a sizable generational leap – and with a much lower launch price this time around. Each of these Compute Units has 64 Streaming Multiprocessors, or SMs, making for a total of 4,096, along with 64 ray accelerators and 128 AI accelerators.
However, the Radeon RX 9070 XT also has less memory than the RX 7900 XT, coming in at 16GB of GDDR6 on a 256-bit bus, rather than 20GB of GDDR6 on a wider 320-bit bus. That’s a hit to both capacity and bandwidth, but it’s still enough to get by in most games at 4K. Still, given that AMD is still on GDDR6, it would have been nice to not get this downgrade at all.
While the new architecture is more efficient, the RX 9070 XT has a higher power budget than the 7900 XT that came before, though not by much. The 9070 XT needs 304W of power, compared to 300W with the older card. It’s an odd increase, especially because in my testing, I found that the 7900 XT still consumed more power, peaking at 314W, compared to 306W from the 9070 XT.
This is a pretty standard power budget in a modern graphics card, so cooling it won’t be too challenging. Unlike any other generation, though, AMD is not launching a reference design for the Radeon RX 9070 XT, which means you’ll have to rely on third-party manufacturers for this GPU. I received the Powercolor Radeon RX 9070 XT Reaper for review, with a surprisingly narrow triple-fan design. Despite its small footprint, though, it still kept the temperature at 72°C throughout my test suite.
AMD is still sticking with standard power connectors too, with the Radeon RX 9070 XT needing two 8-pin PCI-E power connectors, with no meltable adapters in sight. This makes it an easy upgrade for pretty much anyone, provided you have the 700W power supply AMD recommends. As for ports, you get three DisplayPort 2.1a and one HDMI 2.1b, which is exactly what you would expect from a modern graphics card. I do wish AMD would add a USB-C port, though, just for more flexibility.
For years now, AMD has needed an AI upscaling solution that could go toe-to-toe with DLSS. Because while the performance was certainly there with the existing versions of FidelityFX Super Resolution, it has been plagued with ghosting and fuzziness from the word go. AMD addresses that with the Radeon RX 9070 XT, with the AI-powered FSR 4.
Just like DLSS, FSR 4 utilizes the AI accelerators in the Compute Units to analyze previous frames, along with other data from the game engine, in order to accurately upscale a lower-resolution image up to your native resolution. The result does look better than FSR 3, which used a Temporal upscaling solution instead of AI, though it does come with a bit of a performance hit.
In Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 at 4K Extreme settings with FSR 3.1 set to “Performance”, the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT was able to get 134 fps. However, swap that over to FSR 4, and that number goes down to about 121 fps, a 10% performance loss, albeit with better image quality, especially in things like grass or in-game text. Likewise, in Monster Hunter Wilds, the 9070 XT was able to get 94 fps at 4K max settings with both FSR 3 and ray tracing enabled, but dropped to 78 fps when using FSR 4 – a 20% drop in performance.
That’s a bummer, I know, but really it makes sense. By its very nature, an AI upscaling solution is a more expensive workload than the temporal solution AMD was using in the past. I even checked in with AMD and I was told the performance drop was totally expected behavior, and that AMD is hoping the improved image quality will make up for the performance drop. That’s of course going to vary person to person, but it’s worth it if you primarily play single-player games where image quality is more important than raw frame rate.
Luckily, it’s not like FSR 3.1 is going away any time soon. FSR 4 is an opt-in feature: you can easily go into the Adrenalin software and toggle FSR 4 off. In fact, it was turned off by default on my review sample, though that could have been because of early drivers.

AMD really came out swinging with the Radeon RX 9070 XT. At $599, it undercuts the Nvidia Geforce RTX 5070 Ti by a whopping 21%, but ends up being, on average, 2% faster. There are games where the RTX 5070 Ti beats the Radeon RX 9070 XT, but the fact that these two graphics cards are trading blows at all is a win for AMD.
Across my whole test suite, I found that the RX 9070 XT was about 17% faster than the RX 7900 XT – which launched at $899 2 years ago – and 2% faster than the new $749 RTX 5070 Ti. But where this card really shines, especially considering its cost, is at 4K. AMD maintains the same lead at that resolution, making the 9070 XT the ultimate entry-level 4K graphics card, even with ray tracing enabled.
I tested all graphics cards on the most recent drivers available. That means all Nvidia cards were tested with Game Ready Driver 572.60, except for the RTX 5070, which is still on review drivers at the time of writing. All AMD cards were tested on Adrenalin 24.12.1, except for the Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070, which were tested on pre-release drivers provided by AMD.
While 3DMark isn’t a game you can actually play, it still gives a good look at how the potential of each graphics card compares to one another. It’s rare that it reflects real world performance, but it generally gives you a good idea what to expect. And, well, the 9070 XT beats the 7900 XT by 18% in Speed Way, even though it’s 18% behind the RTX 5070 Ti. However, swap to the Steel Nomad benchmark, and the story shifts altogether. The performance jump over the Radeon RX 7900 XT jumps to 26%, and the 9070 XT even beats the more expensive RTX 5070 Ti by 7%.
In Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, the Radeon RX 9070 XT pulls ahead of the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti by 15%. However, it’s clear that this game favors AMD hardware, with the Radeon RX 7900 XT only losing to the new graphics card by 6%.
Cyberpunk 2077 has always performed best on Nvidia cards, so it’s not a surprise that the 5070 Ti beats the Radeon RX 9070 XT, but by less than in previous generations. The Radeon RX 9070 XT gets 71 fps at 4K with the Ray Tracing Ultra preset with FSR 3 set to performance mode. The RTX 5070 Ti with the same settings, but DLSS set to performance mode, gets 75 fps. That’s only a 5% lead, despite the huge price gap.
Metro Exodus is another game with heavy ray tracing, though this one is tested with no upscaling at all. At 4K, the Radeon RX 9070 XT is able to manage 47 fps, which is within the margin of error of the RTX 5070 Ti’s 48 fps. The last-generation Radeon RX 7900 XT really struggles here, only getting 38 fps, making for a 24% jump.
While it's old, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a great showcase of Vulkan performance, and it scales extremely well on the 9070 XT. In everyone’s favorite cowboy-em-up, the Radeon RX 9070 XT gets 125 fps with everything cranked, with the RTX 5070 Ti trailing behind at 110 fps. The 7900 XT trails a bit further behind at 106 fps.
Unfortunately, the winning streak can’t go on forever, with the Radeon RX 9070 XT falling 13% behind the RTX 5070 Ti in Total War: Warhammer 3. What’s worse is with 76 fps the 9070 XT also doesn’t pull that far ahead of the 7900 XT’s 71 fps.
In Assassins Creed Mirage, the RX 9070 XT gets back on the right foot, with its 163 fps outperforming the RTX 5070 Ti’s 146 fps by 12% and the 7900 XT’s 150 fps by 9%. This is another game that has traditionally favored AMD GPUs, but it's still a huge jump over the competition.
The most surprising RX 9070 XT win is in Black Myth Wukong, where it gets 70 fps at 4K with the Cinematic Preset and FSR set to 40%. With those same settings and DLSS, the RTX 5070 Ti gets 65 fps, making for an 8% lead in Team Red’s favor. Black Myth Wukong has a lot of intense ray tracing effects, something AMD hasn’t beat Nvidia at before. It’s incredible how much the Ray Accelerators have improved over RDNA 3, too – the Radeon RX 7900 XT only gets 60 fps, despite having more Compute Units.
Forza Horizon 5 is also getting up there in years, but the Radeon RX 9070 XT still beats the competition, getting 158 fps over the 5070 Ti’s 151 fps. That’s only a 5% improvement, but it demonstrates just how aggressive the 9070 XT is.
Due to how it was announced under the radar at CES 2025, it felt like AMD was holding the Radeon RX 9070 XT as some kind of secret weapon against Nvidia’s Blackwell graphics cards, and I’m glad it did. At $599, the Radeon RX 9070 XT seems like a sort of return to sanity for the graphics card market. Sure, it’s not quite as fast as the RTX 5080 or the RTX 5090, but those cards are overkill for most people – and cost at least $400+ more.
I know I’m not the only one that feels like the last great flagship graphics card was the GTX 1080 Ti when it launched for $699 in 2017. That was the fastest consumer card of its time, and while the 9070 XT can’t quite make that claim, it still feels like the first worthy flagship we’ve seen since then.

PC Gaming has been in a decadent spiral since 2020, and the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT is a reminder that it doesn’t have to be that way. This graphics card has no problem maxing out any game you throw at it at 4K, even with ray tracing enabled, and does so at a price that makes the competition look downright greedy. I can’t predict the future, so only time will tell if the launch price holds up. What I do know is we need more graphics cards like the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT.

TITLE: Black Bag Review
DATE: 
URL: https://ign.com/articles/black-bag-review-michael-fassbender-cate-blanchett-steven-soderbergh
CONTENT:
Black Bag opens in theaters Friday, March 14.

Director Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter David Koepp make one hell of a creative pair. After the paranoid pandemic thriller KIMI and the paranormal first-person-POV drama Presence, their latest collaboration, Black Bag, is an equally skillful melding of genre and style, mapping a web of romantic entanglements onto the espionage genre. Appropriate for this dynamic duo, it’s a movie about partnership: When high-ranking British intelligence officer George Woodhouse (Michael Fassbender) is tipped off about a potential turncoat, his short list of suspects happens to include his wife, Kathryn (Cate Blanchett). A stylish and delightfully tongue-in-cheek whodunnit rooted in questions of marital trust ensues.
When George is handed a list of names by a contact one evening, a series of sly games begins to unfold. The list contains five possible suspects responsible for stealing a potentially deadly software called Severus; their ranks include not only Kathryn, but some of the couple’s closest confidants and acquaintances at the National Cyber Security Centre, or NCSC. As it happens, the other four potential traitors are a pair of couples: rising hotshot James Stokes (Regé-Jean Page) and his sharp-tongued psychiatrist girlfriend, Dr. Zoe Vaughn (Naomie Harris) and married, middle-aged analyst Freddie Smalls (Tom Burke) and his younger mistress, the dangerously frank satellite reconnoiter Clarissa Dubose (Marisa Abela). George’s search is driven by his disdain for liars – especially in matters of love and marriage – making his subtle interrogations of his philandering friends during a dinner party a wry treat. It helps that they’re liquored up, and that their channa masala may have been spiked with truth serum.
Fortunately for us, the answers don’t all present themselves at once. For George, it’s a matter of discerning information bit by bit over several days. He gains leverage by meddling in each relationship, often to hilarious results. However, the further he goes down the rabbit hole, the less likely he is to enjoy what he finds, when signs begin pointing most clearly towards his wife. And that's all merely in the first act of Black Bag. What’s in store from that point forward are numerous twists and turns, each more enticing than the last, as Soderbergh lures us deeper into an often dryly humorous (and extremely thinly veiled) spy-movie metaphor for domesticity.
These aren’t your run-of-the-mill movie spooks working at MI6; they gather intelligence from technology, rather than scrapping and/or sleeping with targets, and they spend their mornings in sterile office rooms surrounded by computers. This doesn’t make them any less suave or sexy (Soderbergh knows full well the expectations of the genre), but it does mean their tools aren’t usually guns and fists. For the most part, their methods involve manipulation and quiet sleuthing, the results of which can be quite droll when the central question becomes the degree to which George is willing to surveil his own wife while tugging at various, complicated threads. Fassbender has the lion’s share of the screen time, and he delivers a wonderfully calculated performance that begins in a state of centered repose. When this sense of control begins to slip from his grasp, we see it on his face. From there on out, it feels like anything could happen.
There are no such control problems for Soderbergh. Once again acting as his own editor and cinematographer (under the names Mary Ann Bernard and Peter Andrews, respectively) he exhibits immense formal poise in every scene. And yet, he allows each scenario to play out with a sense of conversational fluidity despite everyone’s stilted demeanor, as though the spirit of Robert Altman had briefly possessed an obsessive perfectionist like David Fincher. Much like the act of espionage, everything is precisely planned to the letter, but it also feels entirely spontaneous – and it’s made all the more alluring by the hazy, gas lamp wash in every frame. There’s rarely a moment when light sources aren’t visible on camera, emitting a blurry, obfuscating haze. They make the images pop, but never overwhelm them, allowing the ensemble (which also includes a former Bond, Pierce Brosnan, playing George’s intelligence chief) to dictate the rhythm and framing.
The result is a winding, oblique espionage drama that plays out like a heterosexual Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. Despite its mounting complications, it remains far more about its characters and their interpersonal dynamics than the larger geopolitics at play. These are practically an afterthought, making room for one of Soderbergh’s most clockwork films to date: a snappy, self-assured, compact, and delightfully pulpy drama in the body of something slick and prestigious.
A film that projects domestic anxieties onto the espionage genre, Steven Soderbergh’s Black Bag is a slick, self-assured, wildly entertaining spy thriller about a husband-wife intelligence duo forced to question their trust. Its story of three couples working at the same British agency turns all the right screws with impeccable timing, forcing its characters to examine the flaws in their relationships as its tale of state secrets gradually unravels.

TITLE: Severance Chikhai Bardo Explained: What Really Happened to Gemma?
DATE: 
URL: https://ign.com/articles/severance-chikhai-bardo-explained-what-really-happened-to-gemma
CONTENT:
Streaming Wars is a weekly opinion column by IGN’s Streaming Editor, Amelia Emberwing. Check out the last entry Severance May Have Just Laid the Groundwork For the Greatest Betrayal Yet

This column contains spoilers for Severance Season 2, Episode 7.
I try to avoid column entries focusing on the same show two weeks in a row, but Severance has been on one lately so we’re absolutely headed back to Lumon this week.
“Chikhai Bardo” takes us back in time (sometimes), weaving flashbacks with what appear to be current events as we learn about Gemma (Dichen Lachman) and Mark’s (Adam Scott) relationship alongside Gemma’s fight to free herself from Lumon. On our journey with the two, we learn about her miscarriage and their subsequent struggles to conceive even after consulting with a fertility clinic. But, while the glimpse into their past lives makes us feel closer to Gemma, it’s what’s happening in the (presumed) present that blows the lid off things.
While we knew Gemma was alive, we weren’t sure how or to what extent. Her presence at Lumon indicated that perhaps it was only her Innie’s brain that survived, but we never knew how she had an Innie persona to begin with. Additionally, the episode’s title gives us hints as to what might actually be going on while also potentially adding more questions, and we may be closer than ever to learning what the hell is going on with Miss Huang (Sarah Bock).
Buckle up, we have a lot to talk about.
In the episode, Gemma and Mark briefly talk about a set of cards. It doesn’t go well.
“Chikhai Bardo… it looks like two guys fighting,” Mark quips.
“No, it’s the same guy fighting himself, defeating his own psyche. Ego death,” Gemma responds. She adds later that she "thinks she got onto the mailing list at the clinic.”
Mark makes fun of her for doing something he thinks is stupid, she responds in kind that he’s being an asshole, and their brief argument ends with him telling her that maybe they should just stop trying to conceive. It’s a rough moment in the couple’s life, but what’s most interesting here isn’t their fight, it’s what Chikhai Bardo actually means.
Tibetan Buddhism breaks down the cycle of existence into six states, called bardos. Each bardo represents a different stage of life, death and rebirth. Chikhai Bardo is the fourth stage — the bardo of dying. This begins when the body internally and externally senses signs that death is close and results in what is known as the “clear light of death.” The goal in the midst of the clear light of death is to maintain lucidity, but many black out during the process. Meditation and training help with the aforementioned lucidity, but ultimately it’s not something that everyone can achieve.
The above is, of course, a very brief look at this complex and layered aspect of Buddhism; I highly recommend you read up more on the subject if you’re curious, but that’s about as much as we can discuss here without getting too rabbit hole-y. It’s also important to note that the other bardos may very well have their part to play in this story as well, but more on that in a bit!
The structure in “Chikhai Bardo” intentionally keeps the timeline of events muddy and difficult to follow as we experience disorientation alongside Mark, but Gemma is far from the first person severed. The severance procedure was introduced 12 years ago to the public — though recent events imply that it could have been started as early as 20 years ago in the series. Mark joined Lumon and elected to have the severance procedure done only two years prior in the show’s timeline, which means Gemma has been held hostage during that period.
However, it does seem likely that Gemma may be the first severed person of her kind. What I mean by that is the fact that she seems to have multiple severed personas. We have the most experience with Ms. Casey, who is relegated to the severed floor, but we see a new kind of severance with Gemma while she’s deeper in the Lumon facility. There, it’s not severed floors but severed rooms. We see a host of them as she walks down the hall to a room called Wellington, where she meets with her “dentist” (who is presumably playing with severance technology in one way or another), with others including Cairns, Dranesville, Siena, Loveland, and Tumwater. She then passes Rhodes immediately when she leaves with her handler (Sandra Bernhard), and eventually passes Cold Harbor — a room featuring the code name of Mark and MDR’s actual work. It’s later confirmed that Gemma has visited six rooms during the day that the episode takes place: Billings, Locknau, St. Pierre, Cairns, Zurich, and Wellington.
We see Gemma visit one final room before her daring attempt to escape: Allentown. It’s here where Robby Benson’s Doctor Mauer plays house with her, forcing her to write hundreds of thank you notes for fake Christmas gifts the “happy couple” recently received.
What’s most interesting on Gemma’s home floor is that it seems like different rooms may bring out different personalities even further beyond Ms. Casey and whichever personas she’s meant to be during Lumon’s experiment below the severed floor. In Wellington, she seems almost frightened, asking if she may please have a break. In Allentown, her frustration with “her partner” is evident alongside her pain. In an undisclosed room, she’s seemingly on a flight and experiencing extreme turbulence that seems likely to lead to a plane crash. Additionally, each room that we’ve followed her into includes Benson’s Doctor Mauer, with no questions as to why she keeps meeting different versions of him. How many different ways has Gemma’s brain been severed? And what do her teeth have to do with it?
At the beginning of the episode, I didn’t think so. It was my assumption that they found Gemma through the fertility clinic and tricked her by dangling the potential of a child in front of her. However, knowing what we now do about Chikhai Bardo, I absolutely believe that Gemma was, indeed, in an accident. But I also believe that it was Lumon who caused it.
Earlier in the season, Mark also insists that he “saw the body!” when people are trying to convince him that Gemma is alive, making those cloning fan-theories seem more likely than ever. Especially given the fact that they had access to Gemma’s DNA thanks to the fertility clinic which, at this point, I feel pretty confident that they either own or partner with.
Y’all… The possibilities feel endless at this point. What are those little freaks doing with her?
Right now, a prevailing fan-theory posits that Ms. Huang is somehow Mark and Gemma’s kid. Obviously, the math doesn’t math with there only being two years since Mark saw Gemma last, but given that we’re looking at clones, metaphysics and an all-powerful global cult, Lumon’s walking child labor violation sure does seem like she could somehow be their offspring. That would certainly answer the “to what end” aspect of the question, but not necessarily the why part of it.
But the why aspect is likely ultimately pretty mundane. As far as the outside world is concerned Gemma Scout died in a car accident two years ago, Lumon proffered a fake body, and if she (literally) resurfaced, people would start asking a lot of questions. Especially given the fact that keeping Gemma’s outie consciousness seems imperative to their research. She goes outside and you bet she’s going to tell the world what the Eagans and their cult empire are up to.
What at first seems to be a throwaway line ultimately ties everything together in a neat little bow. There are two separate scenes where Gemma notes that she has visited six rooms on her no-good-very-bad-day, and it sure does appear as if each room has a corresponding Bardo, and whatever the Eagans are up to is intrinsically tied to Buddhism and a bastardization of its tenets for their own means.
These are the six bardos:
Kyenay Bardo (Life)
Samten Bardo (Meditation)
Milam Bardo (Dream)
Chikhai Bardo (Death)
Chonyid Bardo (Dharmata)
Sidpa Bardo (Existence)
And these are the six rooms Gemma confirms she’s entered that day:
Billings
Locknau
St. Pierre
Cairns
Zurich
Wellington
Kyenay Bardo (life) explains why they need Gemma’s core personality to remain. Throughout the episode we see her doing yoga (Samten Bardo/meditation). Milam Bardo (dream) remains in question, but Chikhai Bardo (death) goes beyond her car accident and explains the near-death plane ride we saw her on, despite us not knowing the corresponding room. That leaves her dentist experience as well as Chonyid Bardo and Sidpa Bardo in question. Allentown — her thank you card nightmare with Dr. McCreepy — is not one of the six rooms corresponding to a Bardo, which feeds into the idea that it isn’t part of the experiment. The guy just wanted some extra time to be a predator.
What’s particularly interesting when it comes to the “to what end” aspect of the why is what Lumon needs her for and how the bardos play into it all. They’ve made it abundantly clear that Mark’s participation in and completion of Cold Harbor is imperative, but is Gemma there for whatever Cold Harbor is or something else entirely? Is Mark somehow killing the last vestiges of the wife he knows? Are they trying to grow an army of child laborers so they don’t have to deal with the question of Outies vs. Innies ever again? Or is it an army of clones for the same purpose? AND WHAT DO THE GOATS HAVE TO DO WITH ALL OF THIS?!
All we know at this point is that the introduction of the bardos all but confirms the longstanding theory that the master plan here involves helping Kier Eagon continue eternal life, but I suspect we’re gonna get a good amount of explanation on the “how” real soon.
Doctor Mauer, as seen in different personas for each room we’ve met him in, including Gemma’s private chambers where she bludgeons him with a chair and makes her escape, is key to everything involving Gemma. He’s in love with her, but that seems to be more of a complication that came later rather than a reason for her current incarceration.
I have no evidence to support it yet, but there’s something about this guy that just screams Eagen descendent. Perhaps much of that is tied to the fact that Eagens seem to be the only people at Lumon allowed to show emotion, or maybe it’s just because (bless you, Robby Benson) he’s got hardcore cult leader face.
Ultimately, I have no idea if this guy is anything more than just a creepy mad scientist. But I mostly just hope Gemma hits him with a chair again.

TITLE: Invincible Season 3, Episode 7 Review – “What Have I Done?”
DATE: 
URL: https://ign.com/articles/invincible-season-3-episode-7-review-what-have-i-done
CONTENT:
The biggest strengths and weaknesses of Invincible season 3 collide in “What Have I Done?” Thus far, it’s had to choose between plot momentum and character development, and nowhere is that more apparent than when a team of alt-universe Invincibles invade Chicago, wreaking havoc and forcing the Mark we know to fight them off. It’s a major turn, resulting in a handful of powerful moments, but it doesn’t have the necessary grounding to fully connect.

“What Have I Done?”’s main issue is its lopsided setups and payoffs. Angstrom Levy unleashing a multiversal squadron of evil Marks is a huge conceit, but it’s one that’s been relegated to a handful of post-credit stingers thus far. To defend against these invading villains, the GDA and the Guardians seek the help of some classic, Silver Age-style heroes who play a major part in the episode (and even die along the way, in scenes meant to generate sympathy), but these are characters we’ve never seen before, whose names and personalities we never learn.
Still, so much happens in “What Have I Done?” (and so much of it is downright vicious and intense) that it’s hard to discount it, despite all the missteps. A flashback shows us how Angstrom survived despite being beaten to a literal pulp by Invincible – he had a legion of tech-savvy surgeons at the ready in a pocket dimension, and just enough life in him to conjure a portal – leading to his multi-Mark incursion all these months later.
While the Mark we know (let’s call him Mark Prime) has an awkward chat with Eve about meeting her superhero-averse parents, all hell breaks loose across the globe, as up to 18 Invincible variants wreak havoc on suburbs and metropolitan landmarks alike (as well as one pesky Mummy’s tomb, a gag whose refusal to pay off after three seasons is actually absurdly funny). Each invading Invincible has a slightly different design – a Mohawk, an old-school bandit mask, a more Omni-Man-like costume – but each is still recognizably Invincible, and Steven Yeun provides just enough variation in each vocal performance to sell the illusion.
Mark Prime being so vastly outgunned is a fun setup in the vein of Dragon Ball Z. However, the way this plot unfolds is less exciting, given that the three primary Guardians killed by the evil Invincibles are Dupli-Kate (of whom there are multiple copies, so she can’t really die), Immortal (whose name says it all), and Shapesmith (whose survival, despite being torn in two, has a convenient explanation). There’s plenty of onscreen carnage this week, but it’s hard to get invested in most of it, since a reversal always seems to be right around the corner. Rex appears to spontaneously explode in order to take out one of the Invincibles, but whether or not he’s truly dead – and thus, whether or not his romantic arc with Rae has concluded – remains uncertain. Similarly, Donald appears to have reconciled his status as a resurrected android entirely offscreen, but who knows how long this acceptance will last. It often feels like “What Have I Done?” pulls at existing threads with too much force, if only for the sake of convenience, and having supporting players join the fight.
Eve, on the other hand, is gravely injured (it’s rare to see such a visceral fracture on the show, so kudos on that front), forcing Mark Prime to choose between looking after her and tracking down his numerous variants. Lucky for him, this debate is easily resolved when the evil Marks all turn on Levy and the genius supervillain simply sends them all packing to another dimension. It’s a bit too expedient, given the numerous all-is-lost moments in the episode’s second act, and too easily clears the path for Mark’s confrontation with Levy, which feels truncated too.
Despite Oliver’s insistence that Mark kill Levy – it seems his arc about rejecting murder hasn’t been resolved after all – our hero hesitates, letting him escape in the process. At the very least, this poses a further complication for Mark if Levy returns, since that would be a direct outcome of Mark avoiding lethal force. He’s damned if he does (by way of Powerplex showing up again to seek revenge for his past destruction), and it would seem he’s also going to be damned if or when he doesn’t.
However, we may not have to wait all that long to find out the answer, not only because next week’s episode is the season finale, but because of the note on which “What Have I Done?” ends. For all its structural wonkiness and wheel-spinning, it ends with Mark in a more complicated position, torn between a rock and a hard place as a new Viltrumite envoy named Conquest shows up to confront him. In that moment, he’s so emotionally beaten down that it puts him in a fighting mood, and poised to make rash decisions. That’s one hell of a hook for next week.
A topsy-turvy episode in more ways than one, the latest Invincible brings chaos – and 18 multiversal variants – crashing down on Mark. "What Have I Done?" struggles with Invincible’s usual tendencies of wonky setup and payoff: A lot happens, and not all of it is satisfying, but it’s rife with the kind of large-scale destruction (and bloodshed, both consequential and inconsequential) that separates the series from most of its tamer superhero ilk.

TITLE: The 15 Best RPGs Of 2024
DATE: 
URL: https://kotaku.com/2024-best-rpgs-this-year-ff7-dragon-age-4-elden-ring-1851717064

We’re living through a role-playing game renaissance right now. The last several years have been full of great ones, and 2024 is no different. Everywhere you look the genre is growing, evolving, and dominating. From Japanese-style RPGs to Western-style ones, retro remakes to open-world sequels, there’s never been more to dig into for fans of exploration, branching dialogue, or just making the numbers go up.
This year saw the release of ambitious blockbuster RPGs iterating on tried-and-true formulas as well as bold mashups borrowing from the genres’ best to create something new and equally satisfying. The games were also long, from nearly 15 hours to over 65. Finishing every game on this list by focusing on the critical paths alone would take you roughly 513.5 hours, or about three months of treating them like full-time jobs. But of course the real delight of most RPGs is taking your time, exploring every last NPC conversation and dead-end path in a leisurely fashion until you’ve seen everything the game has to offer. And the following games offered a lot.
2 / 17
I confess, the Octopath Traveler games left me a bit cold. I was utterly dazzled by their visuals but, in my estimation at least, they failed to actually capture the spirit of the games to which they were so reverently paying homage. But finally, Square Enix has nailed it by thoughtfully applying the HD-2D aesthetic to one of the actual masterpieces of the pixel art era, Dragon Quest III. The result is one of the best JRPGs of all time, given extraordinary new life through a visual treatment that respects the look and world design of the original game but makes that world newly wondrous to behold, popping with depth, tactility, light and shadow. It’s one of many RPG remakes this year that preserves what makes the original so terrific, enhancing visuals or other elements in such a way that newcomers and longtime fans alike can experience (or re-experience) these exceptional games in a way that feels fresh, contemporary, and alive. — Carolyn Petit

Dungeons of Hinterberg is the kind of RPG I want more of in my life. It mixes a contemporary setting with magic and monsters to create an oddly cozy action RPG that is hard to put down thanks to how it constantly builds on itself. The way Hinterberg is structured also helps as it forces you to interact with all of its systems, including the ability to develop friendships with other characters and explore its large maps filled with goblins, treasure, loot, and dungeons. By the end of Hinterberg, I was sad to be finished with it, but happy that I got to experience one of the best RPGs of 2024. — Zack Zwiezen

Many RPGs flatter the player with power fantasies and fated hero stories that make them an unstoppable force at the center of the universe. Dragon’s Dogma II wasn’t afraid to instead repeatedly knock you on your ass and make you adapt to everything from limited inventory systems to entire plagues. Its high-friction open world is risky but rewarding, full of unique emergent stories that belong solely to the person who experienced them. As Cole Kronman wrote in our review, “Dragon’s Dogma 2 is a game unburdened by any influence save that of its own predecessor; it is, on every level, a supremely confident melding of ideas; it contains at least a little bit of everything I’ve ever loved about video games.” — Ethan Gach
5 / 17
I went into Granblue Fantasy: Relink knowing almost nothing about the mobile game that preceded it, and found myself unexpectedly in love with its breezy sky pirate backdrop, crunchy combat, and streamlined structure. The game is split up into discrete missions designed to be endlessly replayed as you chase better scores, rewards, and end-game resources, and I can’t say the story left a very deep impression on me beyond the broad strokes of its heroic saga about fighting the evil empire and the powerful magic forces maneuvering beneath its surface. And that’s all fine. It nails the vibes and has a grand sense of  scale, all while not getting in the way of the main attraction: big boss fights with slick and rewarding real-time action combat complete with MMO-like party synergies. — Ethan Gach
6 / 17
Secret of Mana is an all-time favorite of mine. I’ve been waiting for a sequel to live up to the series’ SNES-era hype ever since. Visions of Mana is not a top-three Mana game, but it’s still a surprisingly good one. Solid combat and a vibrant if somewhat empty open world are propelled to the next level by wonderful music, old-school dungeons, and a great class-based progression system. Visions of Mana’s uniquely whimsical world was a breath of fresh air that reminded me how much more there can be to modern RPGs than grim sci-fi dystopias, modern schoolyard grinds, and classic medieval dragon slaying. It’s a shame the team behind it, NetEase’s Ouka Studio, was shut down as soon as the game shipped, but I’m hopeful it’s not the last we’ll see of this new era of Mana after the game’s director, Ryosuke Yoshida, joined Square Enix this month. — Ethan Gach
7 / 17
Twenty years ago, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door on GameCube enchanted me and countless other players with its wonderful writing, engaging combat, and elaborate papercraft world, so delightful to behold and explore. Not all games stand the test of time, but this year’s Switch remake proves that TTYD’s excellence really is timeless—if anything, the game has only grown in my estimation in the two decades since I first played it. It just goes to show you that characters this endearing, aesthetics this appealing, and gameplay mechanics this lively and approachable never go out of style.—Carolyn Petit

Metaphor: ReFantazio iterates on Persona’s calendar and social mechanics and ushers in a new era for Atlus’ social-sim RPGs. Its complex battle system and overtly political story make it a standout for a studio that’s no stranger to acclaim. Atlus has found a new pillar in its stable of franchises, and I’m looking forward to whatever the future looks like for this exciting new series. — Kenneth Shepard
9 / 17
Persona 3 Reload is the best version of the best Persona. The from-the-ground-up remake maintains all the important parts of the 2006 classic while modernizing a lot of the dated mechanics and story elements that make the original a harder sell in 2024. It’s good to have such a readily accessible version of Persona 3 and its DLC to remind us that even though Persona 5 was what pulled the series into the mainstream, P3 is still the most consistent entry in the modern trilogy. — Kenneth Shepard
10 / 17
Vanillaware’s last decade has quickly cemented it as one of the most exciting and interesting studios operating around the periphery of traditional RPGs. 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim was a fascinating remix of visual novel storytelling and kaiju battle strategy sim, and this year’s Unicorn Overlord is an equally rewarding twist on the classic tactical RPG. Like a modern auto chess reimagining of Ogre Battle, Unicorn Overlord takes Vanillaware’s flashy art style and applies it to a dense medieval political epic that plays out across slick 2D battles and top-down real-time strategy maps. It’s like a big bowl of slow-cooked oatmeal: long and repetitive yet rich and filling. — Ethan Gach
11 / 17
Dragon Age: The Veilguard has been a divisive game for both good- and bad-faith reasons, and despite its stumbles, it still feels like the result of BioWare having its priorities straight for the first time since Mass Effect 3. The Veilguard features one of the studio’s best casts, gutting narrative twists, difficult decisions, and expressive combat. With it, BioWare is making a concerted effort to wrap up over a decade of worldbuilding and potentially make space for what  comes next. Whatever that looks like, it feels good to be excited for the studio’s future once more. — Kenneth Shepard

Amid UFO 50’s bounty of games from a fictional developer of the 1980s is Grimstone, a JRPG that’s aesthetically and mechanically akin to games of the era like the original Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest but that also distinguishes itself in some important ways. It eschews the fantasy settings that dominated the genre then (and the sci-fi ones, too—I didn’t forget about you, Phantasy Star) for its own distinctive world, one with archetypes and imagery rooted in Westerns but with some horror-adjacent elements as well. Of course, there are the monsters and demons running rampant in the world, but there’s also the fact that the world’s currency is teeth, a detail which continually unnerved me across my ~15 hours with the game.
I’ve seen people complain that Grimstone is “poorly designed,” they feel, because it doesn’t tell you what the different items you find throughout do. That’s a valid argument, I suppose, but part of what I loved about Grimstone—and indeed, about UFO 50 in its entirety—was the way I was encouraged to experiment, to push up against the limitations of games and see what the rules of their different worlds were. It’s a type of discovery that once felt common in games—many people my age, I think, know the feeling of encountering an opaque game on a relative’s computer, or being left alone with grandpa’s Intellivision—but that’s become increasingly rare as more and more games build thorough instructions into the games themselves rather than expecting you to keep a manual on hand. That sense of progress and discovery never flagged during my time with Grimstone—finding each new town where I could rest at the inn was always a huge relief; conquering each new dungeon was always a thrill; scoring cool new weapons and spells was always a great reward for my efforts. And while Grimstone’s storytelling is fairly minimal by today’s standards, discovering the truth about its world was exciting, particularly because that world is so distinct from the worlds of the actual 1980s JRPGs I’ve played. Not unlike my time with Final Fantasy I’s pixel remaster a few years back, playing Grimstone was a terrific reminder that distilling the genre down to its fundamental essence and giving us just enough detail for our imaginations to do most of the work of bringing a world to life can still be a wonderfully captivating approach for a role-playing game. — Carolyn Petit

Oh, what a glorious remake. In 1981, Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord was released and changed gaming forever, with its deadly monsters and devious dungeons helping to establish the template for party-based computer role-playing. Still, important as it was, it was hard to go back to that game today; at the time, players’ eager imaginations would fill in the gaps of its wire-frame dungeons, but nowadays, those primitive visuals and the game’s many other inconveniences stood between most players and the excitement and cultural impact of Sir-Tech’s masterpiece.
Enter Digital Eclipse, who knew exactly what to enhance and what to leave alone in bringing PGotMO into the modern era. Transparently built right on top of the original game, this remake brings the dungeons and monsters to vibrant life with lush, atmospheric 3D visuals and terrific sound effects, while also implementing a slew of quality-of-life improvements that cut down on needless frustration while preserving the original game’s vision and difficulty. In the 40+ years since Wizardry’s release, storytelling in role-playing games has evolved tremendously, but playing it this year reminded me that there’s still no substitute for the thrill of delving ever-deeper into a deadly dungeon, enduring hardship and defeat on the road to conquering its traps and defeating its monsters, and making up a story in your own head about the party of heroes you’ve created to tackle it all. — Carolyn Petit

True, it’s only an expansion. Yes, you have to play dozens of hours and beat tons of hard bosses just to access it. And yet there’s no denying that Shadow of the Erdtree is  way more of one of the best games of 2022 without being just more Elden Ring. “Shadow of the Erdtree is nothing short of magnificent,” wrote former senior editor Alyssa Mercante. “It is both an expansion to and a distillation of what makes the original game so special, offering you a chance to try out new weapons and builds while learning far more about the Lands Between than you might have expected. It will delight you in one breath and devastate you the next, forcing you to question your approach, to fortify your spirit.” — Ethan Gach
15 / 17
While many large RPGs with big worlds leave us wondering whether such an abundance of activities and side quests are worth the time and effort, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth raises no concerns about quantity over quality. With a compelling gangster narrative, fantastic characters, and a thoroughly engaging turn-based combat system, Infinite Wealth is easily one of the must-play RPGs of 2024.
Though having knowledge of previous Yakuza games will certainly give you some great context, Infinite Wealth tells a focused story you can appreciate even if it’s your first foray into the series. With a plot centered on protagonist Ichiban Kasuga’s search to meet his long-lost mother, as well as on co-protagonist Kazuma Kiryu’s last days as he succumbs to cancer, the narratives in Infinite Wealth are grounded and intriguing. And despite covering such serious ground as estranged family relationships and terminal illness, Infinite Wealth is never afraid to dive into hilarious absurdities, such as a pet crawfish’s search for love. The game also features a ton of mini-games that are naturally embedded in the top-level gameplay, including an entire island-resort management game.
Infinite Wealth tells rewarding stories of relatable human experiences with dozens of hours of engaging side-activities that rarely burden you with busywork. If you tire of fantastical settings that feel too detached from reality and instead want to follow the sometimes-goofy trials and tribulations of troubled-yet-endearing characters trying to make the best of their difficult lives, Infinite Wealth needs to be on your list if it isn’t already. — Claire Jackson

No RPG has bemused, frustrated, and delighted me more this year than Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. The second chapter in Square Enix’s retelling of its 1997 PS1 hit, it’s way too long and crammed with way too much filler. The endless minigames, distractions, side-shows, and routine overindulgences don’t always hit, but when they do, it makes Rebirth feel like it’s more alive and having more fun than almost any other game other there. Some RPGs are better than the sum of their parts. Rebirth is an epic slog that nevertheless manages to be more interesting, bold, and unforgettable than the average of its many highs and  lows. It’s big-budget gorgeous yet still unabashedly absurd and over-the-top at any opportunity it gets. — Ethan Gach
