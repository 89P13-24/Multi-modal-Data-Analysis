Multi-modal Data Analysis
Scalable Data Collection
📷 Image_Dataset.ipynb
This notebook contains an automated script to download 50 images for 20 different categories. These categories are specified within the notebook. It also includes a use case of the generated data, which is assessing the feature representation capability of a model.

📝 Text_Dataset.ipynb
This notebook contains code to implement a web crawler to extract relevant text for different categories. It also explores how different models capture semantics in text and how they cluster closer sectors based on textual data.

🎙 Audio_Dataset.ipynb
This notebook contains an automated script to record and store audio streams for a given duration (30–90 seconds). Then, it demonstrates Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) to transcribe the audio files, showcasing the strength of LLMs.

🌦 Weather_Dataset.ipynb
This notebook uses the Open-Meteo API for historical weather data collection. It also includes various techniques to visualize time-series data.

🇮🇳 Analyzing_India_with_Data.ipynb
This notebook focuses on Air Quality analysis in India. The data is extracted from a government website and used for in-depth analysis.

Analyzing Flags and Anthems
📜 Data Collection
We use BeautifulSoup to collect data from nationalanthems.info.

🎨 Visual Analysis
This section focuses on:

Different flag aspect ratios
Number of colors in different flags
Correlation between flags
📖 Textual Analysis
Using pre-trained text embeddings, we analyze and cluster textual data to find correlations.

🎶 Audio Analysis
Extracting audio features from each anthem and exploring correlations.

🔄 Multimodal Correlation
We attempt to match anthems (audio) with written versions, analyzing multimodal correlations.
