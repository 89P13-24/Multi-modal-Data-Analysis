Multi-modal Data Analysis
This repository contains six Jupyter notebooks, each designed for different data collection and analysis tasks.

🚀 Scalable Data Collection
📷 Image_Dataset.ipynb

Automates downloading 50 images for 20 different categories.
Assesses the feature representation capability of a model using the generated dataset.
📝 Text_Dataset.ipynb

Implements a web crawler to extract relevant text across different categories.
Uses pre-trained models to analyze semantic similarity and clustering based on textual data.
🎙 Audio_Dataset.ipynb

Automates recording and storing audio streams (30–90 seconds).
Applies Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) to transcribe audio and evaluate LLMs' performance.
🌦 Weather_Dataset.ipynb

Fetches historical weather data using the Open-Meteo API.
Demonstrates time-series visualization techniques for analyzing weather trends.
🌍 Analyzing_India_with_Data.ipynb

Analyzes air quality in India using government-sourced data.
Explores insights through data visualization and statistical methods.
🎵 Analyzing Flags & Anthems
📜 Data Collection

Uses BeautifulSoup to scrape national anthems from nationalanthems.info.
🎨 Visual Analysis

Examines flag aspect ratios, color distributions, and correlations between flags.
📖 Textual Analysis

Extracts text embeddings (pre-trained models) and clusters national anthems to find relationships.
🎶 Audio Analysis

Extracts acoustic features from anthems and explores similarities between countries.
🔗 Multimodal Correlation

Combines audio and text representations to analyze correlations between written and sung anthems.
This repository showcases multi-modal data collection and analysis, integrating images, text, audio, and structured data to uncover hidden insights! 🚀✨
